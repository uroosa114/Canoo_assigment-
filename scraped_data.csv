The company also plans to produce commercial electric vehicles such as vans for fleet, vehicle rental and ride sharing services.[4] History [edit] [ edit ] Canoo was founded in 2017 under the name Evelozcity by Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. Krause worked for Deutsche Bank as its chief financial officer while Kranz worked for BMW as a senior executive. Both men met at rival EV company Faraday Future before leaving together to form their own company in 2017, due to disagreement with Faraday Future's leadership. Krause took on the role of chief executive officer at Evelozcity, and Kranz became chief technology officer.[5] The company received its primary funding from Chinese investor Li ""David"" Pak-Tam/Botan and German entrepreneur David Stern.[6][7] In April 2018, Evelozcity Canoo hired Karl-Thomas Neumann, the former head of Opel as a senior executive.[8] In March 2019 Evelozcity was renamed Canoo.[9] In July 2019, Neumann left Canoo, but he remained an investor in the company.[10] In September 2019, the company presented its first vehicle prototype, the electric van Canoo, which was later renamed to the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle.[11] In February 2020, Hyundai Motor Group, the parent company of Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors, announced that the company would partner with Canoo on the joint development of a new electric vehicle platform. The platform would be used for compact vehicles and for fleet vehicles such as shuttles. The deal is part of Hyundai's Strategy 2025 program which will see Hyundai investing US$87 billion for five years starting in 2020.[12][13][14] In July 2020, co-founder Stefan Krause left the company. He had previously taken an extended leave of absence in August 2019 for family reasons. Co-founder Ulrich Kranz assumed the role of permanent CEO upon Krause's departure.[15][16] In July 2020, Canoo featured on the TV program Jay Leno's Garage.[17] In September 2020, Canoo announced a merger with the special-purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV., intending to list Canoo on the NASDAQ valued at $2.4 billion.[18] The expectation was to raise $300 million to help finance the production of the Canoo minivan, planned for launch in 2022.[19][20] On December 22, 2020, Canoo completed its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV.[21] A few days before its stock exchange debut, the company announced its MPDV (Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle) product line. The entry level van was expected to sell for $33,000 on arrival in limited quantities in 2022, ramping up to volume production in 2023.[22] In mid-January 2021, The Verge reported that in the first half of 2020 Canoo had been in talks with Apple for a potential role in its secretive Titan car project.[23][24] In May 2022, it was reported that Canoo was struggling to find funding, the company saying that it had only enough funding to operate for one more quarter.[25] It was also revealed around the same time that Canoo was suing investor Pak Tim Li, claiming they were selling shares improperly.[26] In December 2022, the company sued several former executives of stealing Canoo's trade secrets and poaching talent for their new business,[27][28] competing EV startup Harbinger Motors.[29] Corporate changes [edit] [ edit ] On March 11, 2021, Canoo announced the Canoo Pickup Truck, an electric pickup set to release in 2023.[30][31] Canoo announced plans to offer both single-motor and dual-motor all-wheel drive options for their pickup truck, with the latter being capable of producing 600 hp (450 kW) and 550 foot-pounds (750 J) of torque.[30] The company said that the truck would have over 200 miles (320 km) of range and a 1,800 lb (820 kg) payload capacity.[30] After the announcement, shares of the company rose by 14%.[31] It was announced in March 2021 that Canoo had terminated its partnership with Hyundai Motor Group due to a change in corporate strategy. The company also announced that it would shift away from vehicle subscriptions to selling commercial vehicles.[32] On April 22, 2021, the company announced that co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was stepping down and would be replaced by chairman Tony Aquila as CEO.[33] Also in April 2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into Canoo after its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV due to a string of executive departures, sudden changes to its business model, and class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders.[34] On June 17, 2021, the company announced they would build a new factory in Pryor, Oklahoma (just outside Tulsa) to manufacture all of their future vehicles.[35][36] The plant will be used to build ""pod-shaped vans it calls 'lifestyle vehicles' beginning in 2023.""[36] The same day, Dutch media reported that the Dutch company VDL Nedcar would start producing Canoo Minivans for the European market.[37] Later in the year, Canoo and VDL ended the manufacturing agreement.[38] On November 15, 2021, the company announced it would move its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas and establish a manufacturing plant there.[39] As of December 2022[update] the company still lists Torrance, California as its headquarters.[1][40] In January 2022, Canoo entered into a 10-year US$17.7 million lease for a building in Bentonville, Arkansas for an ""advanced industrialization facility"" to be used for low-volume manufacturing.[41] In August 2022, Canoo disclosed they had contracted with a third party for their initial vehicle production. Following receipt of orders in October 2022, Canoo announced plans for construction of a vehicle battery production facility at the MidAmerica Industrial Park (MAIP) in Pryor, Oklahoma.[42] This was in addition to its earlier announcement of plans for a vehicle production plant at MAIP capable of producing 300,000 vehicles per year.[43] In late November 2022, Canoo announced an agreement to purchase of an existing 630,000 square foot plant in Oklahoma City to start vehicle production by 2023, prior to completion of its micro megafactory in Pryor.[44] In April 2023, the company announced that battery production would proceed at Pryor to fulfill a United States Department of Defense contract; and, while vehicle manufacturing was to start in Oklahoma City before the end of 2023, long range plans still included vehicle assembly at Pryor because the OKC facility would not meet full production needs.[45] The Oklahoma City plant transaction was completed on April 7, 2023; the plant was formerly owned and operated by Terex.[46] Firm orders [edit] [ edit ] On April 13, 2022, NASA selected Canoo to supply crew transportation vehicles for its Artemis program, with a total contract value of $147,855.[47][48] In July 2022, Walmart entered into a definitive agreement to purchase 4,500 all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) from Canoo, with an option to buy up to 10,000 in the future.[49] Under the terms, Walmart can terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days notice.[50] Canoo announced two major orders in mid-October 2022. Zeeba, a relatively unknown fleet leasing operation, also based in Greater Los Angeles, ordered a combination of 5,450 LDVs and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV), with a binding commitment of 3,000 by 2024.[51][52][53] Some days later, Canoo announced its biggest sale to date, an order from Kingbee, a Utah-based work-ready van fleet rental company. In addition to the binding order of 9,300 LDVs, Kingbee has the option to double the order.[54][55] Kingbee outfits its vans for fleet customers in construction trades (electrical, plumbing, energy), delivery, and mobile health.[56] In January 2024, Canoo announced the Postal Service (USPS) order for six right-hand-drive LDV vans.[57][58][59] References [edit] [ edit ] ^ a b ""Canoo Investor Relations"". investors.canoo.com.

To run a complete and effective competitive analysis, use these ten templates, which range in purpose from sales to marketing to product strategy. Featured Resource: 10 Competitive Analysis Templates Download Now 1. Determine who your competitors are. First, you‘ll need to figure out who you’re competing with to compare the data accurately. What works in a business like yours may not work for your brand. So how can you do this? Divide your “competitors” into two categories: direct and indirect. Direct competitors are businesses that offer a product or service that could pass as a similar substitute for yours and that operate in your same geographic area. On the flip side, an indirect competitor provides products that are not the same but could satisfy the same customer need or solve the same problem. It seems simple enough on paper, but these two terms are often misused. When comparing your brand, you should only focus on your direct competitors. This is something many brands get wrong. Let's use an example: Stitch Fix and Fabletics are both subscription-based services that sell clothes on a monthly basis and serve a similar target audience. But as we look deeper, we can see that the actual product (clothes in this case) is not the same; one brand focuses on stylish everyday outfits while the other is workout-centric attire only. Yes, these brands satisfy the same need for women (having trendy clothes delivered right to their doorstep each month), but they do so with completely different types of clothing, making them indirect competitors. This means Kate Hudson‘s team at Fabletics would not want to spend their time studying Stitch Fix too closely since their audiences probably vary quite a bit. Even if it’s only slightly, this tiny variation is enough to make a big difference. Now, this doesn't mean you should toss your indirect competitors out the window completely. Keep these brands on your radar since they could shift positions at any time and cross over into the direct competitor zone. Using our example, Stitch Fix could start a workout line, which would certainly change things for Fabletics. This is also one of the reasons why you‘ll want to routinely run a competitor analysis. The market can and will shift at any time, and if you’re not constantly scoping it out, you won‘t be aware of these changes until it’s too late. We're committed to your privacy.

You‘ll want to analyze your competitor’s complete product line and the quality of the products or services they're offering. You should also take note of their pricing and any discounts they're offering customers. Some questions to consider include: Are they a low-cost or high-cost provider? Are they working mainly on volume sales or one-off purchases? What"

For Canoo press materials, including photos, please visit press.canoo.com.For investors, please visit investors.canoo.com. Non-GAAP financial measures This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (""NGFMs"") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") rules. Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance. Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business. Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Learn More Electric vehicle start-up Canoo Holdings (GOEV -1.99%) said in conjunction with its third-quarter earnings report on Monday that it is accelerating its manufacturing plan and now expects to begin building vehicles at a factory in Oklahoma before the fourth quarter of 2022. (GOEV -1.99%) -1.99% Canoo reported a net loss of $80.9 million ($0.35 per share) for the third quarter, much of that attributable to research and development expenses and administrative spending. Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had, on average, expected a larger loss of $0.44 per share. The company had no revenue in the quarter, and none was expected. Texas-based Canoo is preparing to launch a series of electric vehicles based on its proprietary ""skateboard"" platform, which incorporates motors, batteries, suspension, and chassis structure into a single unit that is designed to be as flat as possible, to maximize the usable space inside the vehicle. Among the noteworthy points management made in the report: Canoo now expects to begin production of its first product, the electric Lifestyle Vehicle, before the fourth quarter of 2022. Image source: Canoo. Separately, management said that it has selected a site in Bentonville, Arkansas, for the company's headquarters, and a separate site in Fayetteville, Arkansas, for a research and development center, and that it is planning additional facilities near its factory in Oklahoma. CEO Tony Aquila said that the company expects more than incentives from the deals to build facilities in Arkansas and Oklahoma. ""In June, we announced Pryor, Oklahoma, as the location for our owned manufacturing facility,"" Aquila said. ""We have expanded this partnership to include Arkansas and additional locations in Oklahoma."" Aquila said that the new deals will bring Canoo about $100 million in incentives, on top of the roughly $300 million it has already received from Oklahoma. ""In addition, with these agreements, we are targeting approximately $100 million in vehicle orders with the states and universities where we are locating these facilities.""

It’s particularly hard (and confusing and incredibly time-consuming) if you’re relatively new in business. Most of the data is ridiculously difficult to get. Even if you manage to dig something up, you always seem to be left with more questions than answers. How did they manage to get $10M in funding? Did that absurdly expensive ad campaign pay off? Did their CEO leave because things aren’t going well at the company? What does it all mean? At least that’s what I felt when I was just getting started with competitive analysis. Whether you’re facing a similar struggle or just aren’t sure where to start, I hope this article will help you navigate through every step of the process. In this article, I will share the competitive analysis framework my team and I have developed (through weeks of research and dozens of iterations), and give you some tips on where to look for data that isn’t publicly available so you can have a competitive advantage. But before we start… Competitor analysis is the process of evaluating your direct competitors’ companies, products, and marketing strategies. To make your analysis truly useful, it’s important to: Which brings us to why competitor analysis is worth doing in the first place. This framework will work well for entrepreneurs, business owners, startup founders, product managers, creators, and marketers. It covers business metrics, a product analysis, and a marketing assessment, with the marketing bit being a little more in-depth. Feel free to skip certain parts if you’re only interested in one aspect, or better yet, delegate some steps to respective teams if you can. It doesn’t matter much what kind of product you’re selling or how mature your business is. To use this framework, you may already have a fully functional product, an MVP, or even just a product idea. I’ll be using certain analysis tools to facilitate and automate certain bits of the process. Most of them are either freemium or have a free trial available, so all that you’ll need to invest into the analysis is your own time. Done properly, competitive analysis will give you plenty of quantitative and qualitative data to back your own business decisions and business strategy (and no, I’m not talking about cloning your competitors’ strategies to come up with a second best product, although this can sometimes work ). Namely, it can help you: I can sense you rolling your eyes at me, but hear me out. If you’re serious about competitive analysis, it’s not enough to just evaluate the two Industry Leaders everyone’s talking about (that kind of analysis will likely get you depressed real quick). The competitors you pick for the analysis determine the insights you’ll get at the end, and the decisions you’ll make, based in part on those insights. That’s why including different kinds of competitors (big and small, direct and indirect) into the analysis is critical if you want the results to be comprehensive. Here’s a handy way to think about your competition that’s based off of Myk Pono’s classification: It’s best to include at least one competitor from each category into your analysis to make it truly comprehensive. Whether you can instantly think of over a dozen competitors or can barely recall five, it’s a good idea to turn to Google or a different a search engine (DuckDuckGo, anyone?) and look up your product category. Examine the products within the top 50 results, along with the ads that are displayed in response to your query — more likely than not, you’ll come across companies you’ve forgotten about, or maybe even learn about a few newcomers. To give you an example, I’m going to imagine I’m launching a vacation rental website — an alternative to AirBnB. Here’s what my list of competitors may look like broken down by categories: Now that you have a comprehensive list of your competitors with similar products, it’s time to start the actual analysis. As you go through the process, feel free to use this Google Sheets template I’ve created. In the spreadsheet, I like to divide the factors into collapsable sections (yes, these do get pretty lengthy). I also tend to add comments under each aspect with details or links that provide more info. Depending on the stage you’re at with your business, you can also add in a column for your own product to quickly see how it compares to competitors. I’ll go into depth about each section below, and again feel free to grab this competitor analysis template to follow along. Your analysis should start with digging up the basic info about your competitors: things like the company’s founding year, the names of the CEO and other key people, locations of the company’s offices, how many employees work there, etc. You’ll usually find bits of this information on competitors’ websites. The company’s LinkedIn profile is often useful, particularly for employee counts. And for info on key people, offices, and founding date, CrunchBase is a great resource. Here’s a sample Crunchbase company profile of VSCO, an image- and video-editing app. Your competitors’ job openings can also be found on their websites, LinkedIn, and job search sites like Glassdoor and Indeed. Knowing who they are hiring and which teams they are expanding will give you an idea of what steps they’re about to take, both product- and marketing-wise. Are they about to hire their first sales rep or content marketer? Are they looking for a developer with a specific skill set? Combined with what you know about your industry, your competition’s job openings will tell you a lot about where they are going with their business. You could also take things one step further and see if you can get an understanding of competitors’ corporate culture. The best place to dig through employee reviews is Glassdoor. There, you can find out what employees think about the culture, the team, the pay, the management – and those are often honest opinions because a lot of the feedback is anonymous. Here’s an example of a Glassdoor company review of Bonobos. Knowing when, how much, and from whom your competitors received funding can also be important, particularly if you plan on raising capital yourself. It will give you a solid idea on how much funding you can expect to get. On top of that, venture capitalists (VCs) tend to invest in only one company in a given category so as not to cannibalize their own investments. If an VCs’ name is missing from your competitors’ funding history, they might be a good candidate for you: they missed out on the chance to work with a successful competitor, but now they have the opportunity to invest into a promising startup in the industry (you!). Your competitors’ revenue and number of customers deserve a separate section in your spreadsheet. For some companies, you’ll be able to find estimates on Owler , but those will often be very rough. A Google search for the name of your competitor combined with the words “revenue,” “customers,” etc. might lead you to interviews or press releases where the companies share this information (because, well, everyone likes to brag). That said, I bet you won’t be able to find every competitor’s revenue figures this way. To help you dig deeper, I have two hacks to share that go beyond a simple Google search: Hack #1: Set up alerts for competitors’ interviews and conference presentations. This one requires some time, but it’s very effective in the long run: you’ll be surprised at just how much your competitors give away at event presentations and in interviews, without being aware of you listening. All you need to do is sign up for Awario (there’s a free 14-day trial available), create an alert for the names of your competitors’ CEOs or other key figures (don’t forget to put the names in double quotes to search for an exact match), and select YouTube as the source for the search. And that’s it! You can now binge-watch those videos right in Awario, without having to leave the tool for a minute, noting your findings along the way. Hack #2: Use this revenue formula Jason Lemkin of SaaStr offers a simple formula you can use to calculate a competitor’s revenue estimate, provided you know how many people work there. Take the number of employees the company has listed on its LinkedIn profile and multiply that by $150,000 if well-funded ($200,000 if modestly funded). This should give you an estimate you can work with. These details, combined with company info like founding year and employee counts, are important so you can use them as a benchmark against your own growth. How much time did it take each of your competitors to get to the revenue figures they have today? Are you doing as well as a current market leader back when it was an early-stage business? It’s time to evaluate your competitors’ products or services, the actual things they’re selling. What kind of technology are they using to build it? What is their core selling point? Are there any perks that come with the product: a freemium version, complementary free tools, or services? Let’s get down to the core of your competitors’ business – their product and its key features. A word of caution: this will likely be the longest bit of your spreadsheet. It’s a good idea to divide the features into groups of related ones to keep things organized. Assessing competitors’ pricing pages is another crucial step in your analysis (if pricing isn’t available on their website, try reaching out to their sales team). Here are some questions to consider: Another thing you can draw from competitors’ pricing strategies is great ideas for A/B testing. Do they offer monthly or annual plans? (If it’s both, what is the default option?) How many packages have they got? Identify the opportunities for your experiments, and prioritize the ones that are common for several competitors. Dig through your competitors’ websites to see if they offer something complimentary with their product. Do they have a free trial or a freemium version? Are there any “free” tools their customers get access to, or perhaps a perks program in partnership with other tools? Competitors’ technology is an important aspect to assess for tech companies. BuiltWith is a great (and free) tool to figure out the tech stack that a competitor uses. Just type in the URL, and you’ll be able to see what technology the website runs on, along with any third-party scripts and plugins it uses, everything from analytics systems, email marketing services, to A/B testing tools, and CRMs. A lean alternative to BuiltWith is What Runs, which is a browser extension that analyzes any webpage you’re on. Here’s an example of What Runs and the website tech stack that The Sill uses. On top of that, looking at competitors’ job postings (yes, again) is a great way to see what kind of technology stack they’re using by analyzing the skills they require from candidates. To look for job openings, check your competitors’ websites and job search sites like Glassdoor and Indeed. Your next big step in analyzing the competition is looking at what their customers have to say about them. In this section, you’ll look at each brand’s Share of Voice, the sentiment behind their mentions, the key topics customers bring up when they talk about your competitors, and"

Team Asana facebook twitter linkedin Jump to section Competitive analysis involves identifying your direct and indirect competitors using research to reveal their strengths and weaknesses in relation to your own. In this guide, we’ll outline how to do a competitive analysis and explain how you can use this marketing strategy to improve your business. Whether you’re running a business or playing in a football game, understanding your competition is crucial for success. While you may not be scoring touchdowns in the office, your goal is to score business deals with clients or win customers with your products. The method of preparation for athletes and business owners is similar—once you understand your strengths and weaknesses versus your competitors’, you can level up. In this guide, we’ll outline the steps for a competitive analysis and explain how you can use this marketing strategy to improve your business. With our free competitor analysis template, you can identify who you’re up against and create a more insightful business plan. Competitive analysis involves identifying your direct and indirect competitors using research to reveal their strengths and weaknesses in relation to your own. Direct competitors market the same product to the same audience as you, while indirect competitors market the same product to a different audience. After identifying your competitors, you can use the information you gather to see where you stand in the market landscape. The purpose of this type of analysis is to get a competitive advantage in the market and improve your business strategy. Without a competitive analysis, it’s difficult to know what others are doing to win clients or customers in your target market. A competitive analysis report may include: A description of your company’s target market Details about your product or service versus the competitors’ Current and projected market share, sales, and revenues Pricing comparison Marketing and social media strategy analysis Differences in customer ratings You’ll compare each detail of your product or service versus the competition to assess strategy efficacy. By comparing success metrics across companies, you can make data-driven decisions. Follow these five steps to create your competitive analysis report and get a broad view of where you fit in the market. This process can help you analyze a handful of competitors at one time and better approach your target customers. In step one, select between five and 10 competitors to compare against your company. The competitors you choose should have similar product or service offerings and a similar business model to you. You should also choose a mix of both direct and indirect competitors so you can see how new markets might affect your company. Choosing both startup and seasoned competitors will further diversify your analysis. Tip: To find competitors in your industry, use Google or Amazon to search for your product or service. The top results that emerge are likely your competitors. If you’re a startup or you serve a niche market, you may need to dive deeper into the rankings to find your direct competitors. Once you know the competitors you want to analyze, you’ll begin in-depth market research. This will be a mixture of primary and secondary research. Primary research comes directly from customers or the product itself, while secondary research is information that’s already compiled. Then, keep track of the data you collect in a user research template. Primary market research may include: Purchasing competitors’ products or services Interviewing customers Conducting online surveys of customers Holding in-person focus groups Secondary market research may include: Examining competitors’ websites Assessing the current economic situation Identifying technological developments Reading company records Tip: Search engine analysis tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush can help you examine competitors’ websites and obtain crucial SEO information such as the keywords they’re targeting, the number of backlinks they have, and the overall health of their website. The next step in your analysis involves a comparison of your product to your competitors’ products. This comparison should break down the products feature by feature. While every product has its own unique features, most products will likely include: Price Service offered Age of audience served Number of features Style and design Ease of use Type and number of warranties Customer support offered Product quality Tip: If your features table gets too long, abbreviate this step by listing the features you believe are of most importance to your analysis. Important features may include cost, product benefits, and ease of use. The next step in your analysis will look similar to the one before, except you’ll compare the marketing efforts of your competitors instead of the product features. Unlike the product features matrix you created, you’ll need to go deeper to unveil each company’s marketing plan. Areas you’ll want to analyze include: Social media Website copy Paid ads Press releases Product copy As you analyze the above, ask questions to dig deeper into each company’s marketing strategies. The questions you should ask will vary by industry, but may include: What story are they trying to tell? What value do they bring to their customers? What’s their company mission? What’s their brand voice? Tip: You can identify your competitors’ target demographic in this step by referencing their customer base, either from their website or from testimonials. This information can help you build customer personas. When you can picture who your competitor actively targets, you can better understand their marketing tactics. Competitive intelligence will make up a significant part of your competitor analysis framework, but once you’ve gathered your information, you can turn the focus back to your company. A SWOT analysis helps you identify your company’s strengths and weaknesses. It also helps turn weaknesses into opportunities and assess threats you face based on your competition. During a SWOT analysis, ask yourself: What do we do well? What could we improve? Are there market gaps in our services? What new market trends are on the horizon? Tip: Your research from the previous steps in the competitive analysis will help you answer these questions and fill in your SWOT analysis. You can visually present your findings in a SWOT matrix, which is a four-box chart divided by category. The last step in your competitive analysis is to understand where you stand in the market landscape. To do this, you’ll create a graph with an X and Y axis. The two axes should represent the most important factors for being competitive in your market. For example, the X-axis may represent customer satisfaction, while the Y-axis may represent presence in the market. You’ll then plot each competitor on the graph according to their (x,y) coordinates. You’ll also plot your company on this chart, which will give you an idea of where you stand in relation to your competitors. This graph is included for informational purposes and does not represent Asana’s market landscape or any specific industry’s market landscape. Tip: In this example, you’ll see three companies that have a greater market presence and greater customer satisfaction than yours, while two companies have a similar market presence but higher customer satisfaction. This data should jumpstart the problem-solving process because you now know which competitors are the biggest threats and you can see where you fall short. Imagine you work at a marketing startup that provides SEO for dentists, which is a niche industry and only has a few competitors. You decide to conduct a market analysis for your business. To do so, you would: Step 1: Use Google to compile a list of your competitors. Steps 2, 3, and 4: Use your competitors’ websites, as well as SEO analysis tools like Ahrefs, to deep-dive into the service offerings and marketing strategies of each company. Step 5: Focusing back on your own company, you conduct a SWOT analysis to assess your own strategic goals and get a visual of your strengths and weaknesses. Step 6: Finally, you create a graph of the market landscape and conclude that there are two companies beating your company in customer satisfaction and market presence. After compiling this information into a table like the one below, you consider a unique strategy. To beat out your competitors, you can use localization. Instead of marketing to dentists nationwide like your competitors are doing, you decide to focus your marketing strategy on one region, state, or city. Once you’ve become the known SEO company for dentists in that city, you’ll branch out. You won’t know what conclusions you can draw from your competitive analysis until you do the work and see the results. Whether you decide on a new pricing strategy, a way to level up your marketing, or a revamp of your product, understanding your competition can provide significant insight. There are some drawbacks to competitive analysis you should consider before moving forward with your report. While these drawbacks are minor, understanding them can make you an even better manager or business owner. You don’t just want to gather the information from your competitive analysis—you also want to take action on that information. The data itself will only show you where you fit into the market landscape. The key to competitive analysis is using it to problem solve and improve your company’s strategic plan. Confirmation bias means interpreting information based on the beliefs you already hold. This is bad because it can cause you to hold on to false beliefs. To avoid bias, you should rely on all the data available to back up your decisions. In the example above, the business owner may believe they’re the best in the SEO dental market at social media. Because of this belief, when they do market research for social media, they may only collect enough information to confirm their own bias—even if their competitors are statistically better at social media. However, if they were to rely on all the data available, they could eliminate this bias. A competitive analysis report represents a snapshot of the market landscape as it currently stands. This report can help you gain enough information to make changes to your company, but you shouldn’t refer to the document again unless you update the information regularly. Market trends are always changing, and although it’s tedious to update your report, doing so will ensure you get accurate insight into your competitors at all times.

Kelly LyonsDec 14, 202320 min read Kelly Lyons Dec 14, 2023 20 min read Contributors: Carlos Silva and Zach Paruch TABLE OF CONTENTS A competitive analysis is the process of gathering data about the products, sales, and marketing strategies of your competitors (i.e., other businesses in the same industry). Businesses use that data to identify their strengths and weaknesses and discover potential opportunities. A competitor analysis can help you understand the market landscape and make informed decisions to improve your position in the industry. Depending on your business, you can analyze competitors in many ways. But we’ll cover the basic steps you need to know. Pro tip Generate a competitive analysis snapshot in a few clicks with Semrush’s Market Explorer. Get competitor data, like: Competitive analyses are essential for any business that wants to succeed in a crowded and competitive market. Regularly conducting competitive analyses can help you: Read on to find out how you can get started. The factors you include in your competitor analysis depend largely on your goals and industry. For example, an online pet store owner will want to see what products their competitors sell that they don’t. A SaaS company, on the other hand, will probably want to look into their competitors’ features and pricing pages. To get you started, here are seven factors that stay the same across the board: Compare your features or products to your competitors’ and highlight those that make you stand out or fall behind. For example, if you’re selling an email marketing tool, you might want to compare features such as: That way, you get a clearer picture of what your competitors are doing differently and why. Pricing is the amount of money you charge for your product or service. Use your competitors’ pricing strategy to guide your own. And make sure you’re not over- or under-charging your customers. Suppose you run an online course platform. You might want to compare pricing factors such as: Target audience is the group of people you’d like to reach and serve with your product or service. When conducting a competitive analysis in marketing, try to discern who your competitors are targeting. How does it differ from your target audience? What are their needs, preferences, behaviors, and pain points? Are they targeting someone you aren’t? How can you better serve them? For example, if you run a fitness app, you might want to compare target audience characteristics such as: Marketing is the process of promoting and selling your product or service to your target audience. Look at your competitors’ marketing strategies to identify how you can improve your own. And increase your awareness, visibility, and conversions. For example, if you own a travel booking website, you might want to compare marketing channels such as: Differentiators are the factors that make your product or service unique and superior. Identify what that means for you. Look at how your customers position themselves to find out what sets you apart. And how your product or service is better. Then, communicate those differentiators to your customers. For example, if you sell a vegan meal delivery service, you might want to highlight differentiators such as: Strengths are the aspects of your product or service that give you an advantage over your competitors. List and analyze your strengths in your competition analysis. So that you know what you can double down on. For example, if you run a cloud storage service, you might identify strengths such as: Weaknesses are the aspects of your product or service that put you at a disadvantage compared to your competitors. List these out as well. Acknowledge them. Analyze how they affect your performance and results. And then work on improving them. For example, if you are selling a video streaming platform, you might want identify weaknesses such as: Before you start this walkthrough, grab a copy of Semrush’s Competitive Analysis Template to follow along. Here’s what it looks like: Perform a competitor analysis with these seven steps. Tip Create a free Semrush account (no credit card needed) to follow along with the steps in this guide. First, build a list of key competitors to watch out for. This lets you see who might be competing for your audience’s attention. And gives you an idea of who to focus on throughout your competitor analysis. We’ll walk you through how to find your competitors in these four key areas: So that you can enter your data into your competitive analysis document. Like this: Your industry competitors sell similar products or services to yours. Focus primarily on direct competitors, though. Meaning brands that fill a similar gap within your niche. An example of direct competitors is Abercrombie & Fitch and Aritzia. Both fashion brands focus on trendy women’s clothing—popular with Generation Z and younger millennials. They occupy the same position in the market. An indirect competitor would be Animal Crossing and Mortal Kombat. They’re both video games, but their audiences are vastly different. You should also consider your business’s size and competition level. For example, a local Toyota dealership may rank for similar keywords as the overarching Toyota brand. This doesn’t mean they will directly compete. The local dealership’s competition would be other local dealerships instead. Keep context in mind as you use competitor analysis tools. Here are a few ways to identify direct competitors: For a general view of your digital competitors in your industry, use a competitor analysis tool like Market Explorer. First, select “Find Competitors” and enter your domain. This will automatically generate a list of the major players in your space. The “Overview” tab will show you who you compete with online. It will also visualize their relative market share, audience size, and growth rate. Now, scroll to the “Growth Quadrant” widget. The Growth Quadrant chart breaks down you and your competitors into four basic categories: Note where each competitor stands. And how their audience and traffic growth compare to yours. Which players occupy the same quadrant as you? Which should you be most concerned about? Once you’ve identified key competitors in your industry, research their online presence through organic, paid, and local searches. Next, identify your competitors in organic search. These are brands that target the same SEO keywords as you. These can differ from industry competitors. They may not have the same type of business you do. But they still compete with you in Google’s search results. You can easily find organic competitors with the “Competitors” report in Semrush’s Organic Research tool. Start by entering your domain and clicking “Search.” Then, click on the “Competitors” tab. You’ll see a list of organic competitors sorted by Competition Level. This metric is based on the number of keywords a competitor ranks for. And the number of keywords you and the competitor share. Like so: Note your biggest organic search competitors and any new names that did not appear in Market Explorer. Pro tip Head to the “Position Changes” tab to see the specific keywords your top organic competitors have been ranking for and monitor how their rankings shift over time to identify keyword opportunities. Next, look for your paid search competitors. These are businesses that show up for the paid keywords you’re targeting. Ads that show up for users depend on many factors, including location, device, and context of the search term. A tool like Advertising Research can help you identify who your paid competitors are. And how their paid ads perform. To get started, enter your domain and hit “Search.” Next, head to the “Competitors” tab. Scroll and you’ll see a list of paid search competitors, sorted by competition level: You can also see how many paid keywords you have in common, how much paid traffic your competitors’ ads drive, and how many paid keywords your competitors rank for. If you run a business with a physical storefront, you must identify your local competitors—both online and offline. These are competitors who offer a similar product or service (filling the same market gap) within your geographic area. To do that, track important local keywords and compare your business’s proximity with other sites that rank for those keywords. And you’ll want to make sure your website ranks prominently on Google for location-specific keywords. That means optimizing your site for local SEO so you’ll appear in local search results. Like so: You can start your competitor research by using the Keyword Overview tool. To see what the SERP (search engine results page) looks like for keywords like “pizza near me.” The top-ranking domains are your local SEO competitors. To then track important local keywords and competitors, use the Position Tracking tool. Enter your domain in the Position Tracking tool. And, click “Set up tracking.” Set a local target (e.g., the city or state where your company operates). On the next page, you can add the keywords you’d like to track and click “Add keywords to campaign.” Now, you’re ready to “Start Tracking.” Once your campaign is ready, visit the “Competitors Discovery” tab to find local competitors. You’ll get a list of competitors sorted by “Visibility.” Visibility is based on click-through rate (CTR) and shows a website’s progress in Google’s top 100 ranked webpages for keywords in the current tracking campaign. Take note of competitors who are dominating the local conversation. Then, ensure your website is optimized for local search with up-to-date address and contact information across all your platforms (especially your Google Business Profile). Further reading: Building a profile for each of your main competitors allows you to benchmark important details, including market share and audience demographics. Here’s what that’ll look like in your competitive analysis document: Let’s begin by analyzing market share, or the influence a brand has within their industry. Market share is a percentage of a company’s sales or revenue out of the total sales or revenue for its industry. Publicly traded companies are required to state their earnings every quarter.Many private companies are, too. So, you can get a lot of information by searching “[company name] quarterly report” or “[company name] annual report” in Google. You can also consider estimations from trusted business publications. For example, Yahoo Finance reports on a lot of this information for public companies. Here’s some of the market share information for Apple: To calculate market share, divide the total company revenue by total industry sales. Like this: Here’s a real-world example: Toyota sold 2,332,262 vehicles in the U.S. in 2021. And 15 million total vehicles were sold in the U.S. during the same period. If we divide Toyota’s total sales (2,332,262) by the industry’s total sales (15,000,000), we get 0.155. Multiply that by 100, and we get 15.5%. Which is Toyota’s market share for 2021. We recommend completing this step for your main direct competitors. It’ll help you benchmark your success within your industry. Market share shows you which competitor has the biggest influence over your audience. But it doesn’t tell you who that audience is. Understanding audience demographics can help you connect with customers and create products and services that address their needs. You can use a tool like Market Explorer to analyze any website’s audience demographics. Enter a competitor’s URL and head to the “Audience” tab. This report provides a high-level overview of the audience demographics in your niche, including: Next, find out how your audience compares to and overlaps with your closest competitors. You can do this with Traffic Analytics. Select “Check Competitors.” Then, enter your domain and up to four competitor domains into the search bar, and click “Analyze.” Now, head to the “Audience Overview” tab. You’ll see a side-by-side comparison of each domain’s audience. And how much they overlap. It’s time to round out your competitor profiles by filling in basic company information. This provides context that could help you analyze your findings. And build a more competitive marketing strategy. For example, one of your competitors may have only been around for a few years.

10 marketing trends to watch for in 2024 | TechTarget,https://www.techtarget.com/searchCustomerExperience/feature/Marketing-trends-to-watch-for,"Customer Experience Customer Experience Customer Experience Login Register Customer Experience Customer Experience Getty Images/iStockphoto By Swing Education 12 Feb 2024 The constantly evolving marketing landscape requires successful marketers to keep abreast of emerging trends. Understanding and adapting to these trends -- driven by the often-clashing forces of technological advancements, consumer behaviors, market dynamics and global events -- is essential for marketers to maintain a competitive edge in today's fast-paced, digital-centric world. By paying close attention to and learning from these trends, astute marketers gain valuable insights into their consumers' evolving needs, preferences and behavior patterns. Better still, they provide their companies with more effective, targeted and personalized marketing strategies. To unlock new avenues of growth, marketers must experiment with new tools and technologies, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for personalized marketing, as well as employing virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) for immersive customer experiences. Here's a look at key market trends in 2024, their central role in driving innovation and growth, and how these trends, if properly understood and harnessed, make brands more resilient within their unique marketplaces and against an ever-growing competitive landscape. AI and ML are poised to significantly influence marketing trends this year and beyond because they streamline and personalize consumer experiences. In 2023, the Sprout Social Index found that 81% of marketers say AI has had a positive impact on their work and that it also helps in creative areas such as content planning and productivity. AI and ML automate some repetitive tasks, freeing marketers to focus on strategy and creative initiatives. Moreover, these technologies analyze vast amounts of data to glean insights for a more targeted, efficient marketing strategy adaptable to changing consumer behavior patterns. AI and ML also excel at personalizing the customer journey by tailoring ads and product recommendations, as well as predicting future consumer behavior. In this instance, AI algorithms process a customer's past behavior, social media interactions and other data to forecast their future actions, allowing companies to cater proactively to their preferences. Finally, AI and ML contribute to more effective customer segmentation. Instead of relying on broad demographic information, these technologies partition customers based on nuanced behavioral patterns and preferences. This allows brands to create highly tailored marketing campaigns that resonate with specific customer groups. As the adoption of smart speakers and voice-activated devices continues to rise, the shift to voice search optimization is expected to continue, underpinned by consumer preference for hands-free, voice-activated technology. Additionally, with advancements in natural language processing and AI, voice search technology delivers more accurate and personalized responses, which contribute to a positive user experience. The increased prevalence of voice search also brings about a significant change to the search engine optimization (SEO) landscape. Traditional keyword strategies require reevaluation as voice searches typically involve more conversational and long-tail phrases. Moreover, the ""position zero"" or featured snippet on search engine results pages becomes even more desirable since voice assistants often pull their responses from these highlights. Hence, marketers need to adapt their SEO strategies to ensure their content is voice search-friendly and capable of earning that coveted spot. Furthermore, voice commerce represents a promising frontier for businesses. As consumers become more comfortable using voice commands to complete a range of tasks, the leap to voice-activated purchasing is natural. Brands that optimize their content for voice search are better positioned to tap into this emerging market, driving sales and enhancing customer convenience. The increase in the use of chatbots, including both AI-powered and rules-based versions, is a compelling trend for several reasons. First, chatbots offer companies a cost-efficient, round-the-clock customer service solution. They can handle multiple customer queries simultaneously, providing immediate responses and improving customer satisfaction levels. AI-powered chatbots learn from every interaction, enabling them to deliver increasingly personalized responses over time and enhance user engagement.Second, chatbots are highly versatile marketing tools, used not only for customer service but also for product recommendations, appointment scheduling and lead qualification. This versatility becomes increasingly valuable as businesses seek to maximize their online engagement. Additionally, rules-based chatbots provide a consistent, reliable service that's adaptable to a brand's specific requirements, making them a preferable option for companies that deal with straightforward customer queries. Third, along with increasing customer engagement and potential revenue for businesses, chatbots save company resources -- both time and dollars. Brands that engage in personalized marketing create a bond with their audience, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Unlike generic marketing, personalized marketing speaks directly to the customer, addressing that individual's unique needs and preferences. This shift to building trusting relationships and providing a better customer experience promises increased conversions, customer retention and, ultimately, revenue growth. Additionally, with advancements in AI and ML technologies, the possibilities for personalization are expanding. Brands can analyze customer behaviors and preferences in real time, allowing them to finetune marketing efforts to each customer. This leads to more effective and efficient marketing strategies, as resources are concentrated on the most impactful channels and methods, ultimately improving return on investment (ROI). The ubiquity of internet connectivity and the ever-increasing power of modern smartphones have made video content more accessible than ever before. Consumers can now stream high-quality video on the go, making it a powerful tool to catch their attention and deliver impactful messages. Moreover, platforms such as TikTok, as well as features like Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts have popularized short-form video content, driving brands to adopt this format to reach and engage their audience. In addition, video content offers a unique blend of audiovisual elements that allows marketers to tell more engaging and persuasive stories, helping their products and services stand out in a saturated market. Video content can seamlessly incorporate customer testimonials, product demonstrations, behind-the-scenes insights and many other elements that build trust and cultivate a deeper connection with the audience or even encourage purchases. Lastly, video marketing impacts key metrics such as SEO, conversion and click-through rates. Research shows that incorporating videos into marketing emails can boost click-through rates, while embedding videos on landing pages can increase conversion rates. Indeed, successful video marketing in 2024 aligns with the data-driven approach that modern marketing strategies strive to adopt. By enabling direct purchases within the same social media apps where consumers connect, share and inspire each other, social commerce platforms are transforming the shopping journey into a seamless, convenient experience. With features ranging from shoppable posts to in-app stores, brands have the opportunity to target and convert consumers within a familiar social context, effectively shortening the path to purchase. Moreover, social commerce leverages the power of user-generated content and peer-to-peer influence, key elements in today's consumer decision-making process. Consumers can see how products look in real life, read reviews and even make inquiries to brands through direct messages, all in one platform. This immersive, interactive shopping experience, coupled with the ability to instantly share and discuss products with friends and followers, amplifies word-of-mouth marketing and encourages impulsive buying behaviors. As such, social commerce is expected to keep its momentum in the marketing landscape and can be used in conjunction with a marketing team's growing omnichannel customer experiences. This marketing trend establishes an authentic connection with audiences that traditional advertising struggles to achieve. Influencers have a strong rapport with their followers, which makes their promotional content more engaging, relatable, impactful and trustworthy. The intersection of influencer marketing, video content, and social commerce creates a potent combination for brands. As consumers continue to shop directly from social media platforms, influencers tap into this trend by creating engaging video content showcasing products, encouraging their followers to click through and make a purchase. This seamless integration of shopping and social media amplifies the efficacy of influencer marketing and underlines its importance in a company's marketing strategies. The continued adoption of sustainable and ethical marketing reflects a growing consumer consciousness around environmental impact and social issues. As people become increasingly informed and concerned about the biosphere, the ethical and sustainability practices of a business come into sharp focus for discerning would-be consumers. It's an opportunity for businesses to differentiate themselves, align with consumer values and forge stronger connections with their customer base. In addition, companies adopting sustainable and ethical marketing practices gain a competitive advantage. Research shows that consumers are willing to pay a premium for products and services from companies committed to positive social and environmental impact. As such, sustainable and ethical marketing is not just a trend, but a strategic approach likely to drive consumer behavior and loyalty. VR and AR technology will be adopted by more businesses in 2024, transforming how companies interact with their customers, especially as it becomes more accessible to small- and medium-sized businesses. These immersive technologies offer an entirely new level of engagement, allowing consumers to experience products or services in a simulated environment before purchase. This not only enhances the customer's understanding of the product, but it also creates a memorable, engaging experience that increases brand loyalty. In addition, AR and VR provide marketers with innovative ways to tell their brand stories. For instance, AR can overlay digital information on physical products or locations, providing an interactive experience. Meanwhile, VR can transport users to entirely new environments -- a virtual showroom or exotic location tied to a brand's narrative -- and even show how furniture or other large fixtures would fit in a specific room. These technologies change the dynamics of customer engagement and experience. Marketers realize that comprehensive, accurate data can provide invaluable insights into customer behavior, preferences and trends. The ability to capture and analyze such vast volumes of data enables businesses to anticipate market changes, predict customer behavior and adjust their marketing strategies accordingly, leading to improved efficiency and higher ROI. The convergence of machine learning and big data is opening up new vistas in predictive analytics, allowing for more precise customer segmentation and targeting. With sophisticated analytics tools, marketers can derive actionable insights and make more informed decisions, from identifying the most effective marketing channels to optimizing campaign performance. Thus, leveraging big data and analytics is not a new trend, it's a fundamental shift in the marketing landscape. Griffin LaFleur is a MarketingOps and RevOps professional working for Swing Education.

"Canoo, the EV startup that scored a deal with the world's largest ...",https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Already have an account? BY Sheryl Estrada Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue. Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year. On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans. “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.” “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career. Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported. As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes.

Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue. ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers. Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business.

Canoo Sticks to 2023 Production Target | IndustryWeek,https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/companies-executives/article/21263239/canoo-sticks-to-2023-production-target,"Search Search Topics Resources Leadership Companies & Executives Jennifer Ramsay Electric carmaker Canoo will shift from R&D to focus more on manufacturing in 2023, hoping to further slash operating expenses following a 45% reduction last year, CEO Tony Aquila said. Executives expect operating expenses to be between $55 and $70 million and capital expenditures between $30 and $45 million, both reductions from 2022 goals. “Migrating from an R&D design and premarket delivery to a manufacturing and market launch organization hitting these milestones will better help us manage the current market turbulence,” he said. Ramping up production in 2023 means hitting a 20,000-unit run rate at its Oklahoma City factory, a number executives have held firm on since Q3. Canoo currently has a $2.8 billion order book, including 4,500 vans to be used as Walmart delivery vehicles. Aquila’s affirmation of Canoo’s production target stands in contrast with Arrival, another EV commercial vehicle startup, which had to dial back its ambitions over the past year (On a related note, General Motors Corp.'s BrightDrop division will this year deliver the first 200 of 4,000 electric vans to Ryder System Inc.). But Canoo still has work to do: When asked about the current level of preparedness, Aquila said they were in the “65%-ish range of items on the ground, probably at north of 85% with what's inbound,” although they’d found a workflow that supported their confidence in achieving it. (On a related note, General Motors Corp.'s BrightDrop division will this year deliver the first 200 of 4,000 electric vans to Ryder System Inc.). Canoo announced its Q4 results on March 30, which showed it failed to generate any revenue in the quarter and experienced a comprehensive loss of $82 million, compared to $138.1 million in Q4 2021, and $487.7 million for the year, compared to $346.8 million last year. The company posted a going concern at the end of Q1, as it lost $125 million in the period and had less than that in cash left. Q4 also saw Canoo settle the SEC investigation into whether former senior executives had misled investors, and the company will pay a $1.5 million fine as result. Despite the lows of the year, executives remained optimistic about the big picture. They delivered Canoo’s first light tactical vehicle (LTV) to the U.S. Army and entered a partnership with a Saudi Arabian distribution company. With the investigation wrapped up, Aquila said Canoo can now apply for government programs such as the “Department of Energy loan program and things of that nature.” After reporting earnings, Canoo stock (Ticker: GOEV) fell from trading at $0.62 per share to $0.60 the following day, although it ended up rising to $0.69 that same day. Over the past six months, they have continued a general downward trend, currently trading 66% lower than the Oct. 2022 high. Join today!

Four trends in consumer behavior in 2023 | McKinsey,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-world-of-ands-consumers-set-the-tone,"Skip to main content Sajal Kohli (4 pages) Leading consumer-facing businesses place a lot of emphasis on listening to consumers, as they should. Consumer sentiment and behavior can be fast changing, confusing, and sometimes contradictory. Today’s consumers, for instance, are both trading down and selectively splurging. They’re buying big, established brands and exploring newer, smaller ones. Many of their buying decisions are a matter of “and,” not “or.” Staying attuned to these trends in consumer behavior can be difficult for companies, but doing so is absolutely critical—even (or perhaps especially) when the ands seem paradoxical. Quick decision making on how to meet consumers’ expectations in this world of ands must be at the top of a company’s agenda. In addition, businesses must prioritize a series of ands themselves to grow profitably and outperform competitors. This article outlines the ands that we see playing out in consumer behavior, along with the ands that business leaders need to act on. Many of the insights I’ll be sharing with you are powered by ConsumerWise, McKinsey’s proprietary solution that tracks and analyzes both consumer sentiment (what consumers say and how they feel) and consumer spending (what they actually do)—thus providing a 360-degree view of today’s consumers. ConsumerWise currently spans ten markets; by the end of 2023 it will expand to 20 markets, covering 90 percent of global GDP. Our latest ConsumerWise research reveals that consumers are engaging in the following four ands. It also reveals that trade-offs are false choices. Consumers are both flocking to value and buying premium products and services. Worldwide, approximately two in three consumers are trading down by buying cheaper brands or private-label products. In Europe, 84 percent of consumers perceive branded products as having similar quality to private labels. In China, consumers are becoming more value conscious and aggressively seeking discounts and promotions. At the same time, 44 percent of consumers around the world (and 60 percent of Gen Zers and millennials) say that they plan to splurge, particularly on purchases that are experiential or provide immediate gratification—think restaurants or travel. Regionally, intent to splurge closely aligns with economic optimism: 77 percent of Indian consumers plan to splurge, compared with only 26 percent of Japanese consumers. In short, consumer spending is falling globally, and midpriced goods and services are most at risk. Shoppers who splurge in some categories may seek value in others, which means companies must develop a detailed and nuanced understanding of trends and segments. The majority of consumers now use at least three channels for each purchase journey. And while 75 percent of consumers want a seamless omnichannel experience, only 25 percent are satisfied with the experience that retailers provide. Omnichannel excellence is especially important given that omnichannel consumers are at least 1.25 times more valuable than their single-channel counterparts. Consumers are also increasingly adopting new shopping channels. More than 60 percent of US and Asian consumers plan to continue using channels that they first tried during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as grocery delivery or social commerce. Traditionally, big brands have dominated the consumer landscape, especially during times of uncertainty. In the US market, big brands grew 50 percent at the height of the pandemic. But consumers are also trying new brands: one in three consumers did so in the past three months. Gen Zers and millennials are especially susceptible to brand switching, as they are five times more likely than older generations to believe that newer brands are better or more innovative than established brands. In general, consumers are now purchasing a repertoire of products to fill specific needs, instead of purchasing just one product. To illustrate: whereas ten years ago a typical household would have had just one type of milk in the fridge, a household today might buy cow’s milk, high-protein milk, and a plant-based alternative such as almond milk or oat milk—each for a unique occasion. Consumers are gravitating toward sustainable products: 84 percent say that sustainability is a very important factor in their purchase decisions. However, 50 percent say they’re not sure whether they would pay a premium for sustainable products in times of inflation. Still, products making sustainability-related claims are growing faster than products that make no such claims. Companies face the challenge of striking a balance between sustainability and price, which is especially critical in an inflationary environment. In addition to keeping their finger on the pulse of the ever-more-demanding consumer, businesses should respond to these trends with their own ands. Companies need to be uncompromising in the following three areas. Approximately 60 percent of top-performing CEOs are concerned about an economic downturn. Even amid the highest global inflation since the 1970s, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, and volatile commodity prices, investors continue to expect profitable growth above the historical average. Against this backdrop of uncertainty, CEOs have a unique opportunity to make distinctive decisions that lift their companies above competitors. Fortune favors the bold, and pursuing growth must be a conscious, strategic choice. Companies are more likely to outperform peers when they pursue multiple pathways to growth, including expanding into new categories and new geographies. Changing global demographics, in particular, are unlocking new growth opportunities. Consider that Africa will account for more than half of global population growth in the coming decades, and that GDP for both China and India continues to climb in global rankings. Companies that successfully expand into new geographies are 22 percent more likely to achieve above-market, accretive growth. Companies that wish to keep up must speed up—and scale up. The pandemic created a greater chasm between retail leaders and laggards: more than 90 percent of growth in retail market cap was driven by 25 large, tech-forward retailers. We expect further market consolidation, accelerated by the end of cheap capital. But scale must not come at the expense of personalization. The bigger your company, the better you should get at localizing and personalizing your offerings. More than 70 percent of consumers expect personalization and are frustrated when companies don’t deliver it. Companies that excel at personalization generate 40 percent more revenue from those activities than average players. Historically, more than 80 percent of consumer companies’ growth has come from core offerings. Clearly, nurturing the core isn’t optional—and we’ve found, in fact, that many companies underestimate the core’s growth potential. But as consumer behaviors diverge, companies must seek to become indispensable in consumers’ lives by expanding beyond products and into a range of services. Companies would do well to start pursuing “share of life,” not just share of wallet. Traditional sector barriers are falling; McKinsey research suggests that one-third of global GDP will soon come from ecosystems (which are networks or partnerships that cut across different industries). And consumers are receptive: for example, 60 percent of European consumers say they’re willing to buy services from retailers they trust. Companies can also tap into B2B opportunities—an excellent example being the rise of retail media networks, which generate a significant amount of incremental revenue and operating margins as well as generating valuable new consumer insights. Consumers today live in a world of ands—they’re much more demanding and less willing to make trade-offs. Businesses, too, should live in a world of ands. If they take an uncompromising stance on the three aforementioned imperatives, the payoff will be above-average growth and healthy margins.

In many ways, 2020 marked a change in how digitalization impacted both individuals and businesses. Consumers have adjusted the way they live and work, and delivering on those consumer preferences has become the new business battleground. In fact, 70% of consumers believe that a business is only as good as its customer service, with 67% of customers willing to pay more for brands that offer better service. Although some changes have merely accelerated the adoption of habits already emerging — such as a preference for personalization and digital-first interactions — other changes spell out a lot more introspection from brands. During my conversations with leaders from some of the world’s most influential brands, I uncovered three key trends that are forever reshaping customer expectations. Digital Is Here To Stay Today, customer journeys often begin with a digital experience, and they’re not limited to one specific channel. Since the pandemic began, digital interactions have replaced in-person experiences, so it’s not surprising to learn that live chat and chatbots are the fastest-growing channels globally. Although picking up the phone and calling customer service remains the most frequently used way to interact with brands, more than 40% of consumers now use live webchat, making it the second most popular channel. With this shift in consumer behavior, it’s no coincidence that digital-first customer service solutions have emerged as their own software category with customers flocking to digital channels. What does that mean for your company? It means that investing in digital is no longer a nice-to-have, and offering self-service digital channels is a must. For example, financial institutions used to rely on clients visiting branch locations to have that personal connection with their financial consultants. That wasn’t possible for a while with Covid-19, so as a result, we’ve seen a dramatic uptick in digital channel usage. FORBES ADVISOR One executive from a Fortune 500 financial institution told me that the company shifted its entire online CX strategy to let customers self-serve in a way that eliminated waiting time, but the customers never felt like the bank didn’t remember them or their history. Company leaders also noticed customers were increasingly tweeting questions about financial planning challenges, but it was hard to provide personalized help on such a public channel. The company deployed an omnichannel strategy that allowed for conversations to start anywhere, but then brought customers into a more comfortable, context-rich channel where they could have a realistic and candid conversation about their financial health. The key to making this work in the real world is experience orchestration. With empowered agents that have visibility into the full customer journey — including historical transactions, previous customer service exchanges, preferred contact channels and movement from one channel to another — companies can deliver a truly connected experience while leveraging the power of digital. Real-Time, Event-Driven Communication Is Expected As we move into another phase of the pandemic with increasing in-person interactions and movement, it’s more critical than ever to unify and improve the customer experience across both physical and digital channels. A current example is curbside pickup — a shift in consumer behavior that’s predicted to likely outlast the pandemic. Popularized by big retailers like Walmart and Target, curbside pickup has since expanded beyond the grocery space, with nonessential retailers like Best Buy and Nordstrom offering the service as an option as consumer uptake continues. Completing and coordinating successful curbside pickups require clear communication throughout the buying process. The key to making this work for your brand is a next-gen CX architecture that can easily allow data and context to be shared across business units and functions — from the warehouse to the POS, to a mobile app, to customer support and beyond. Delivering successful omnichannel experiences is only possible when systems are connected across sales, marketing and service. As consumers continue to rely on digital for many transactions and services that can’t yet happen in person, maintaining a streamlined customer experience across all channels will play a pivotal role in purchasing decisions today and building long-term loyalty in the future. Values Matter More Than Ever The last year brought about a renewed sense of awareness of social causes amid the unique circumstances of the pandemic, environmental and social crises. Consumers around the world are adjusting their shopping habits in a quest to support businesses that are socially responsible. Accessibility is a cornerstone of great customer experiences and great brands but is often overlooked as part of a sustainability program. Companies like Genesys partner Be My Eyes use video to allow blind and low-vision people to have someone else “see” for them to overcome access barriers. In addition to providing an enriching experience, this also makes good business sense. In fact, when it comes to the visually impaired, two-thirds of e-commerce transactions are abandoned due to a lack of accessibility. Other companies getting it right include mindfulness app Headspace, which responded to the Covid-19 crisis by giving away free subscriptions to health care and unemployed workers. Also, Genesys client Airbnb recently announced that they will be housing 20,000 Afghan refugees globally for free. For many, the post-Covid-19 world is an opportunity to rebuild for the better. Consumers are seeking more purpose-driven services and products. Companies that utilize the right technologies to communicate with customers at the right time and explore ways to use products and services for good may find themselves best positioned for the next normal.

Blog Design for Business Written by: Masooma Memon Masooma Memon Jul 16, 2022 Thorough competitor analysis is a crucial aspect of any marketing plan. It helps you understand how challenging it could be to crack a market, what strategies could work, and how you can best position your brand. It can also tell you what strategies won’t work, what the customer’s expectations are and how much they’re willing to pay. Without it, you likely won’t survive a day in a new market. You need to study your competition not only when you’re starting out but also periodically after cementing your feet in the market. This way, you can stay on top of your game, consistently growing your market share. Not sure where to start? We’ve got an easy, 6-step competitor analysis template for you in this guide. We’ll also share templates to help you document your findings. team Sign up. It’s free. What Is a Competitor Analysis? The Benefits of Competitor Analysis for Businesses How To Conduct a Competitor Analysis (Step-by-Step) 10 Competitor Analysis Templates To Use Right Away Ready To Try Out This Competitor Analysis Template? Competitor analysis is the strategic research of your competitors to study their strengths and weaknesses. By taking the time to analyze your current and potential competitors, you can identify areas for improvement. You want to look out for things like their value proposition, product, marketing and sales tactics. Besides helping you find gaps in the market, studying your competition helps in the following ways: A competitor analysis seeks to study all available information on your competitors, including their pricing, differentiators, positioning, product portfolio, strengths and weaknesses. The steps below will help you uncover all this and more. Chances are you can recall who your competitors are in a breath. But if you’re new, identifying who your direct and indirect competitors are will take some time. Keep in mind that direct competitors offer products and services similar to yours, positioning them as a substitute for your business. They also mostly target the same audience. On the flip side, indirect competitors are businesses that don’t necessarily offer the same product or service. However, their offering can solve the same customer problem that your business solves. An easy, cost-effective way to identify competitors is by typing in your product type into the Google search bar. Let’s suppose you have a project management software. A quick Google search on this will turn up names of companies offering the same type of software. For creating a comprehensive list of competitors, make sure you google synonyms too. This could be a “project management tool” for the example above. Another useful tactic is to conduct the same research on social media. Type in what your business does and you’ll see similar business names pop up. You can also surf hashtags to learn how other companies are using them. Lastly, if you’re conducting market research interviews, pay attention to the brand names that target buyers mention in their interviews. Once you know who your competitors are, start studying them one by one. Go through their product portfolio. Look at the products they offer, how they position and price them. Record your findings in a worksheet so you can track and analyze the data you’re gathering. Visme allows you to do this quickly and easily. You can also grab a template from Visme’s template gallery and create a product and pricing sketch for each competitor. This will make it easy for you to visualize individual competitors. To determine competitors’ market share, use Statista or a similar resource to get your hands on the numbers. Track and visualize your findings in this template. Customize this template and make it your own! A Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis helps you study what competitors are doing to win customers. You can also use it to identify gaps in your market. For example, let's say a competitor’s customer support team takes pretty long to get back to customers. You can use the information to provide faster customer support and a better experience for customers. As you hunt for competitors’ strengths and weaknesses, study the following areas: Running an ecommerce business? Study competitors’ shipping and product return strategies as well. An effective way to jump-start studying competitors’ strengths, weaknesses and more is through social listening. The goal? To identify what customers are saying about brands on social media channels they use, including chat forums and groups they are a part of. A similar approach is to study customer reviews. This will help you understand what your competitors’ customers are saying about them. Are they satisfied with the product quality? Or are they put off by their onboarding process? Do their support requests take long to get answered? As you go about researching, record your findings in a SWOT analysis template like this one: Customize this template and make it your own! If you’re a Visme user, you have the benefit of coordinating your SWOT research efforts with your team. If you and your business partner are working together on the research work, you can both access and edit the worksheet in Visme at the same time. To do this, use the Share option from the top right side of your project dashboard in Visme. Select ""Share Privately"" and add your partner to the project. From there, you two can collaborate on design, leaving comments for each other. We’ve already mentioned that you need to make notes on how your competitors price their products. But studying their pricing strategy goes deeper. First, review what discounts competitors offer. Then look at how often they offer discounts. Studying your competitors’ promo strategies will help you understand how they’re attracting customers and growing sales. It will also give you a good idea of how much the target market is willing to pay and what their expectations are in terms of discounts. In addition to the manual research to uncover individual competitor pricing, use the same research tools mentioned above — social listening and customer reviews. They'll help identify what customers are saying. Pay attention to how customers respond to the discounts and promotions that competitors run. Some businesses tend to offer discounts shortly after they launch new products. This can be a turn-off for shoppers who like to shop for the latest collections to stand out from their peers. Similarly, other businesses extend product deals now and then despite telling customers it’s their last chance to buy. See if and how that annoys customers and if there’s an opportunity for you to offer something more relevant and unique to the target market. It’s important to study how competitors are raising brand awareness and moving leads down their marketing funnel. Begin by identifying where your leading competitors are funneling their resources. Is it PPC they’re investing in? Or are they taking the community-building approach to attract, engage and nurture customers? Chances are your competitors are big on educating customers, so they’re investing in content marketing. Also, look at which channels competitors are focusing on. Is it Twitter or Reddit? Or do they have a strong presence on Instagram? The answer to this will help you understand where your target audience is present and which marketing channels you should focus on. Take Clearscope, an SEO content optimization tool, for example. They take an educational approach to their marketing by creating lots of webinar content. Source Ahrefs, another SEO tool, on the other hand, is also big on the educational approach. But they create blog content, not webinars. Source In this last step, compile all your research in written format. Create an action plan that includes a tactical list of steps to take. This way, you can discuss and prioritize steps to take with your team. Aim to be concise as you create this competitor analysis document. If you create a wordy report, nobody"

Blog Jodie Shaw Jodie Shaw The ability to anticipate and adapt to emerging trends sets market leaders apart. As we approach 2024, the consumer world is pivoting at an unprecedented rate, influenced by technological advancements, global socio-economic shifts, and a collective reevaluation of values and priorities post-pandemic. For brands, an in-depth understanding of these emerging trends is crucial. It’s no longer sufficient to react to changes as they occur; foresight and strategic planning are essential. Here, we delve into 15 pivotal consumer trends poised to redefine the market landscape in 2024. These trends are not just a passing wave; they are powerful currents reshaping industries ranging from Advertising and Agriculture to E-commerce, Technology, and Telecommunications. Embracing these trends means more than just staying relevant. It’s about seizing opportunities in a rapidly evolving marketplace, delivering value that resonates with modern consumers, and ultimately, shaping the future of your industry. The push for sustainable and ethical practices has moved from a niche concern to a mainstream demand in a world increasingly conscious of its ecological footprint and societal impact. This paradigm shift is not just a moral awakening but a response to the growing evidence of climate change and social inequality. A recent survey revealed that 73% of global consumers are willing to change their consumption habits to reduce environmental impact. This staggering statistic underscores the importance of this trend. The emergence of this trend can be traced back to the growing awareness and accessibility of information regarding environmental and social issues. Social media and digital platforms have played a pivotal role in illuminating the consequences of unsustainable practices. The result is a more informed and conscientious consumer base, demanding transparency, sustainability, and ethical behavior from brands. In the agriculture industry, this trend manifests as a surge in organic and regenerative farming practices. Consumers are increasingly seeking products that are healthy for them and beneficial for the planet. Consumer behavior is impacting food production. The Organic Trade Association noted a rise in organic food sales by 4% in 2022, reaching a record $60 billion in sales within the US that year, a clear indication of this growing demand. Moreover, adopting sustainable agriculture practices is not just a consumer preference but also a business imperative. According to the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, sustainable business models in the food and agriculture sector could open economic opportunities worth up to $2.3 trillion annually by 2030. Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) companies also feel this trend’s impact. There is a notable shift towards products with sustainable packaging, ethically sourced ingredients, and a transparent supply chain. A study by the Boston Consulting Group highlights that brands with a higher positive impact on society grow up to 4.5 times faster than those with a lower impact. This trend pushes CPG companies to rethink their product lifecycle, from sourcing to packaging and disposal. The automotive industry is also undergoing a significant transformation, with sustainability taking center stage. Electric vehicles (EVs) are at the forefront of this change. Bloomberg forecasts that EVs will account for 10% of global passenger vehicle sales by 2025, up from just 3% in 2020. Consumer demand, regulatory pressures, and technological advancements drive this shift. Automotive giants are investing heavily in sustainable technologies, recognizing that the industry’s future is inextricably linked to environmental stewardship. In conclusion, sustainable and ethical practices are no longer optional but critical to business strategy across various sectors. For industries like Agriculture, CPG, and Automotive, adapting to this trend is about meeting consumer demands and ensuring long-term viability in an increasingly conscientious global market. As brands navigate this shift, the ones that authentically embed sustainability and ethics into their core operations will likely emerge as leaders in the new consumer landscape of 2024 and beyond. The era of one-size-fits-all is fading into obscurity as we witness the rise of personalization and customization in consumer preferences. Today’s consumers seek products and services that cater to their tastes, needs, and preferences. This trend reflects a broader shift towards a more personalized consumer experience, emphasizing the individual rather than the mass market. The root of this trend lies in technological advancements that have made data collection and analysis more sophisticated and accessible. With the advent of AI and machine learning, businesses can now gain deep insights into consumer behavior, preferences, and patterns. According to Salesforce, 66% of customers expect companies to understand their unique needs and expectations. This expectation has set a new standard in customer experience that is tailor-made and deeply personal. In e-commerce, personalization has become a key differentiator. Amazon’s recommendation algorithm is a prime example, often cited as a significant driver of its sales, with 35% of purchases coming from product recommendations based on algorithms. This level of customization enhances the shopping experience, increases customer satisfaction, and boosts loyalty. For B2B companies, personalization has evolved from a nice-to-have feature to a critical business strategy. A study by McKinsey & Company shows that 80% of B2B buyers now expect the same buying experience as B2C customers. This includes personalized communication, tailored solutions, and understanding their unique business challenges. B2B businesses that have embraced this trend are seeing substantial benefits, with 15% to 20% higher customer satisfaction rates and a 10% to 15% increase in sales conversion rates. Personalization is taking on a more sophisticated form in the technology sector with the advent of customizable technology solutions. Companies now offer products tailored to specific user preferences, from customizable software interfaces to hardware that can be modified according to user needs. Apple’s iOS, for example, allows users to extensively tailor their phone’s functionality and interface, enhancing user experience and loyalty. Personalization and customization are more than just marketing strategies; they represent a fundamental shift in how businesses interact with customers. They are about creating a unique value proposition for each customer, fostering a deeper connection and a more meaningful relationship. As we move into 2024, businesses across sectors like E-commerce, B2B, and Technology that harness the power of personalization and customization will stay relevant and thrive in an increasingly competitive marketplace. The lines between the physical and digital worlds continue to blur, giving rise to a new era of digital and augmented experiences. This trend, propelled by advancements in AR (Augmented Reality), VR (Virtual Reality), and AI (Artificial Intelligence), is reshaping the way consumers interact with the world around them. It’s a shift towards more immersive, interactive, and personalized experiences driven by a desire for enhanced engagement and convenience. The growth of this trend can be attributed to significant technological advancements and increased accessibility to high-speed internet and smartphones. According to a report by PwC, the AR and VR market is expected to grow to $1.5 trillion by 2030, highlighting the enormous potential and interest in these technologies. This growth is also fueled by the increased consumer appetite for immersive experiences that go beyond traditional media consumption. In the media industry, digital and augmented experiences are revolutionizing content consumption. Streaming services are experimenting with AR and VR to provide more engaging and immersive viewing experiences. For instance, Netflix’s interactive storytelling, like in “Black Mirror: Bandersnatch,” where viewers make decisions that influence the story’s outcome, represents the tip of the iceberg in this evolving landscape. The global video streaming market, estimated to reach $184.3 billion by 2027, increasingly incorporates these technologies to enhance viewer engagement and retention. The telecommunications sector is also at the forefront of this trend. With the rollout of 5G technology, which offers faster speeds and lower latency, telecom companies are enabling more sophisticated and seamless AR and VR experiences. For example, Verizon’s venture into 5D technology promises to revolutionize how consumers and businesses interact with digital content, offering unprecedented levels of interactivity and immersion. Advertising is another industry transforming digital and augmented experiences. Brands are leveraging AR and VR to create more engaging and interactive advertising campaigns. A report by eMarketer predicts that 58.9 million people will use VR and 93.3 million will use AR at least once per month in the US alone. This shift drives advertisers to develop innovative campaigns offering consumers a unique and memorable brand experience, increasing brand engagement and loyalty. The trend of digital and augmented experiences clearly indicates the direction in which consumer preferences are heading. As we advance into 2024, industries like Media, Telecommunications, and Advertising must adopt these technologies and innovate continuously to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Those who succeed in creating immersive, engaging, and personalized experiences will capture the hearts and minds of consumers in this new digital era. The surge in consumer consciousness around health and wellness marks a pivotal shift in lifestyle choices and purchasing behavior. This trend, fueled by a growing awareness of the importance of physical and mental well-being, significantly influences various industry sectors. In an era where health is increasingly viewed holistically, consumers seek products and services that contribute positively to their overall well-being. This trend’s roots can be traced to a combination of factors, including increased access to health-related information, a rise in chronic health conditions, and a growing emphasis on preventive healthcare. A study by the Global Wellness Institute reveals that the global wellness economy is valued at $4.5 trillion, indicating the vast scale and impact of this trend. In the Food and Beverage industry, this shift towards health and wellness is evident in the rising demand for nutritious, organic, and natural products. Consumers are now more inclined towards food and drinks that satisfy hunger and offer health benefits. According to a Nielsen report, sales of products with health attributes rose by 4% globally, outpacing total store sales. This demand is reshaping the industry, with companies increasingly focusing on clean labels, transparency, and health-centric product innovations. The Animal Health sector is also experiencing a parallel shift. Pet owners increasingly treat their pets as family members and are equally conscious about their health and well-being. The global pet food market, expected to reach $128.4 billion by 2025, reflects this trend. There’s a growing demand for premium, organic, and specially formulated pet foods and products that cater to pets’ overall health, including dietary supplements and health-focused pet care products. In CPG, the health and wellness trend is prompting a reevaluation of product portfolios. Companies are reformulating products to reduce artificial ingredients, sugars, and unhealthy fats. They are also introducing new product lines that align with wellness trends, such as plant-based alternatives and functional foods. The global functional food market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7.7% between 2020 and 2025, showcasing the sector’s response to this health-conscious wave. The health and wellness trend is not just a passing fad but a fundamental shift in consumer priorities. As we move into 2024, the Food and Beverage, Animal Health, and Consumer Packaged Goods sectors are poised to see continued growth and innovation in this space. Companies that can effectively tap into this trend and offer products that genuinely contribute to the consumer’s overall well-being will be well-positioned to thrive in the coming years. In an age where time is a precious commodity, the demand for convenience and speed has escalated to new heights, becoming a key determinant in consumer decision-making. This trend, driven by a fast-paced lifestyle and the digital revolution, is reshaping consumer expectations and industry practices across various sectors. The essence of this trend lies in the consumers’ desire for immediate gratification and efficiency in every aspect of their lives. A report by McKinsey & Company highlights that convenience is one of the top factors customers consider when choosing where to shop, with 60% of global consumers citing it as a key factor. In e-commerce, convenience and speed are revolutionizing shopping experiences. The"

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Third Quarter 2021 Financial Results Third Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC. CANOO INC.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC. CANOO INC.

Canoo Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2023 Results,https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/117/canoo-inc-announces-third-quarter-2023-results,"Filing JUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 14, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Canoo Inc. (Nasdaq: GOEV), a high-tech mobility company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2023. JUSTIN, Texas Nov. 14, 2023 ""We are now in our manufacturing and revenue-generation phase, while we still have things left to prove. We have worked nearly three years to get to this point,"" said Tony Aquila, Investor, Executive Chairman and CEO of Canoo. ""The bets we have made around the redesign and functionality of our platform are beginning to play out successfully at multiple levels. We continue to move toward our goal of achieving 20,000 annual unit capacity. I think that's a tribute to the scrappiness of our team driving value to our customers and partners."" Third Quarter & Recent Business Updates: Third Quarter Financial Highlights: Second Half 2023 Business Outlook - Updated Based upon our current projections, we have updated our previously provided second half 2023 guidance as follows: See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, November 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET. To listen to the conference call via telephone dial (877) 407-9169 (U.S.) and (201) 493-6755 (international callers/U.S. toll) and enter the conference ID number 13742318.

Michigan Oklahoma Arkansas Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC. CANOO INC.

Understanding and shaping consumer behavior in the next normal,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/understanding-and-shaping-consumer-behavior-in-the-next-normal,"Skip to main content (5 pages) Months after the novel coronavirus was first detected in the United States, the COVID-19 crisis continues to upend Americans’ lives and livelihoods. The pandemic has disrupted nearly every routine in day-to-day life. The extent and duration of mandated lockdowns and business closures have forced people to give up even some of their most deeply ingrained habits—whether spending an hour at the gym after dropping the kids off at school, going to a coffee shop for a midday break, or enjoying Saturday night at the movies. Share This article, a collaboration between McKinsey and the Yale Center for Customer Insights, was written by Tamara Charm, Ravi Dhar, Stacey Haas, Jennie Liu, Nathan Novemsky, and Warren Teichner. Such disruptions in daily experiences present a rare moment. In ordinary times, consumers tend to stick stubbornly to their habits, resulting in very slow adoption (if any) of beneficial innovations that require behavior change. Now, the COVID-19 crisis has caused consumers everywhere to change their behaviors—rapidly and in large numbers. In the United States, for example, 75 percent of consumers have tried a new store, brand, or different way of shopping during the pandemic. Even though the impetus for that behavior change may be specific to the pandemic and transient, consumer companies would do well to find ways to meet consumers where they are today and satisfy their needs in the postcrisis period. Behavioral science tells us that identifying consumers’ new beliefs, habits, and “peak moments” is central to driving behavioral change. Five actions can help companies influence consumer behavior for the longer term: According to behavioral science, the set of beliefs that a consumer holds about the world is a key influencer of consumer behavior. Beliefs are psychological—so deeply rooted that they prevent consumers from logically evaluating alternatives and thus perpetuate existing habits and routines. Companies that attempt to motivate behavioral change by ignoring or challenging consumers’ beliefs are fighting an uphill battle. The COVID-19 crisis, however, has forced many consumers to change their behaviors, and their new experiences have caused them to change their beliefs about a wide range of everyday activities, from grocery shopping to exercising to socializing. When consumers are surprised and delighted by new experiences, even long-held beliefs can change, making consumers more willing to repeat the behavior, even when the trigger (in this case, the COVID-19 pandemic) is no longer present. In other words, this is a unique moment in time during which companies can reinforce and shape behavioral shifts to position their products and brands better for the next normal. When consumers are surprised and delighted by new experiences, even long-held beliefs can change, making consumers more willing to repeat the behavior. For example, approximately 15 percent of US consumers tried grocery delivery for the first time during the COVID-19 crisis. Among those first timers, more than 80 percent say they were satisfied with the ease and safety of the experience; 70 percent even found it enjoyable. And 40 percent intend to continue getting their groceries delivered after the crisis, suggesting that they’ve jettisoned any previously held beliefs about grocery delivery being unreliable or inconvenient; instead, they’ve been surprised and delighted by the benefits of delivery. Another example of changing beliefs involves at-home exercise. The US online fitness market has seen approximately 50 percent growth in its consumer base since February 2020; the market for digital home-exercise machines has grown by 20 percent. It’s likely that many people who tried those fitness activities for the first time during the pandemic believed that at-home exercise couldn’t meet their exercise needs. That belief has clearly changed for many of these consumers: 55 percent who tried online fitness programs and 65 percent who tried digital exercise machines say they will continue to use them, even after fitness centers and gyms reopen. To reinforce the new belief that online fitness can be motivating and enjoyable, NordicTrack, in a recent TV ad titled “Face Off,” shows that online workouts can foster the same friendly competition and connection that people look for when they go to the gym or attend in-person exercise classes. An effective way to reinforce a new belief is to focus on peak moments—specific parts of the consumer decision journey that have disproportionate impact and that consumers tend to remember most. Peak moments often include first-time experiences with a product or service, touchpoints at the end of a consumer journey (such as the checkout process in a store), and other moments of intense consumer reaction. Some companies have focused on enhancing the consumer’s first-time experience. Plant-based-meat manufacturer Beyond Meat, for instance, was already benefiting from delays in meat production in the early days of the COVID-19 crisis: its sales more than doubled between the first and second quarters of 2020. In collaboration with local restaurants and catering companies, the company has been delivering free, professionally prepared food to hospitals and other community centers. By giving away Beyond Burgers prepared by professional chefs, Beyond Meat is creating positive first experiences with its product at a time when consumers are more open to trial. As the consumer journey has changed, so have the peak moments, and it’s crucial for companies to identify and optimize them. For example, a peak moment in a grocery store might be the discovery of an exciting new product on the shelf. In the online-grocery journey, however, a peak moment might instead be on-time delivery or the “unboxing” of the order (the experience of taking the delivered items out of the packaging). Grocers could consider including a handwritten thank-you note or some other surprise, such as a free sample, to reinforce consumers’ positive connections with the experience. Highly emotional occasions can spark intense consumer reactions and therefore present an opportunity for companies to create peak moments associated with their products or brands. For example, when graduations shifted from formal, large-scale ceremonies to at-home, family celebrations, Krispy Kreme offered each 2020 graduate a dozen specially decorated doughnuts for free. With that promotion, the company connected its brand with an emotional event that may not have been a key occasion for doughnuts prior to the pandemic. Companies can nudge consumers toward new habits through product innovation. For instance, the COVID-19 crisis has spurred consumers to become more health oriented and increase their intake of vitamins and minerals. Unilever reported a sales spike in beverages that contain zinc and vitamin C, such as Lipton Immune Support tea. The company is therefore rolling out such products globally. It’s also aligning its innovation priorities with consumers’ emerging health-and-wellness concerns. Similarly, packaged-food companies can encourage the habit of cooking at home. Spice manufacturer McCormick’s sales in China have sustained double-digit increases compared with 2019, even as the Chinese economy has reopened and people go back to their workplaces. The same pattern could play out in other countries. Kraft Heinz’s innovation agenda for its international markets now prioritizes products that make home cooking pleasurable, fast, and easy—products such as sauces, dressings, and side dishes. These will be targeted at “light” and “medium” users of Kraft Heinz products. Habits can form when a consumer begins to associate a certain behavior with a particular context; eventually, that behavior can become automatic. To help turn behaviors into habits, companies should identify the contextual cues that drive the behaviors. A contextual cue can be a particular task, time of day, or object placement. For example, more consumers are keeping hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes near entryways for easy access and as a reminder to keep hands and surfaces clean. Product packaging and marketing that reinforces the put-it-by-the-door behavior can help consumers sustain the habit. Some companies may need to identify—and create—new contextual cues. Before the COVID-19 crisis, a contextual cue for chewing-gum consumption was anticipation of a social interaction—for instance, before going to a club, while commuting to work, and after smoking. As social occasions have waned during the pandemic, a chewing-gum manufacturer must look for new contextual cues, focusing largely on solo or small-group activities, such as gaming and crafting. Gum manufacturers could consider designing packaging, flavors, and communications that reinforce those new associations. People across the country have felt an intensified mix of anxiety, anger, and fear because of recent events, making marketing a tricky terrain to navigate. The heightened emotions and increased polarization of the past few months could drive lasting changes in consumers’ behavior and shape their long-term preferences. Companies should therefore ensure that all their brand communications are attuned to consumer sentiment. The quality of a company’s communication and its ability to strike the right tone will increasingly become a competitive advantage. McKinsey’s consumer-sentiment surveys show that consumers are paying closer attention to how companies treat their employees during this crisis—and taking note of companies that demonstrate care and concern for people. That has implications for how brands connect with consumers and what types of messages will resonate. Hair-care brand Olaplex, for example, became one of the most mentioned hair-care brands on social media when it started an affiliate program: the company donated a portion of its proceeds from product sales to customers’ local hairstylists, helping them stay afloat during salon closures. That said, consumers will see through—and reject—messages and actions that are performative and that seek to commercialize social issues. A brand’s communications must align with its purpose; otherwise, the messages won’t ring true. Testing marketing messages among a diverse group of consumers, in the context in which those messages will appear, could help prevent costly missteps. Consumer beliefs, habits, occasions, and emotional-need states will continue to evolve rapidly over the next year or two as the world awaits a COVID-19 vaccine. For consumer companies to stay abreast of those changes, monitoring product sales alone won’t be sufficient. Companies must also conduct primary consumer-insights work, with a focus on identifying changed behaviors and associated changed beliefs and motivators to get a comprehensive picture of the changing consumer decision journey. Qualitative, exploratory research will have a particular role to play as a precursor to (and, in some cases, a substitute for) quantitative research. Digital data-gathering and monitoring techniques—such as mobile diaries, social-media “listening,” and artificial-intelligence-driven message boards—will be vital tools to help companies understand emerging behaviors and contextual cues. When structured well, those insights generate new thinking within an organization that can be validated through larger-scale surveys and in-market testing. Companies can then refine their product offerings and marketing messages accordingly. In addition, granular analyses of footfall data and omnichannel sales will unearth telling details, such as which geographic regions are seeing in-person commerce rebound first and which products consumers are buying (such as smaller pack sizes to avoid sharing, activewear versus office wear, and so on). Whereas in the past, companies might have fielded high-level usage and attitude surveys and brand trackers a few times a year, it’s especially important now for companies to keep a closer eye on the evolution of consumer behavior on a weekly or monthly basis. The COVID-19 crisis has changed people’s routines at unprecedented speed—and some of those changes will outlast the pandemic. Even in states and cities that have reopened, consumers remain cautious about resuming all of their precrisis activities. We’ve seen differences in consumer behavior across geographic markets and demographic groups, and those differences will only widen during the recovery phase, given that the health, economic, and social impact of COVID-19 isn’t uniform. Companies that develop a nuanced understanding of the changed beliefs, peak moments, and habits of their target consumer bases—and adjust their product offerings, customer experiences, and marketing communications accordingly—will be best positioned to thrive in the next normal.

9 Key Consumer Behavior Trends (2024-2027) - Exploding Topics,https://explodingtopics.com/blog/consumer-behavior,"You may also like: There's no question about it: consumer behavior is changing faster than ever before. Specifically, what consumers want, where they want it, and when they want to access their products and services are constantly in flux. In this report, we're going to cover 9 of the most important consumer behavior trends in 2024 (and beyond). As people increasingly shop online, they also expect a wide selection of different payment options from online retailers. This includes offering different ways to pay (like accepting credit, debit, and PayPal payments). But also the ability to defer payments over time. In fact, the ""Buy Now, Pay Later"" (BNPL) industry is growing alongside the general growth in eCommerce as a whole. Searches for ""BNPL"" have grown by 843% over the last 5 years. And there's no shortage of fintech startups cropping up to meet the demand for BNPL at checkout. Afterpay (known as Clearpay in the UK) is one of the leaders in this category. But there are several others, like Sezzle, making serious inroads. Searches for ""Sezzle"" have grown by 200% over the last 5 years. have grown by 200% over the last 5 years. Over the last few years, we've seen a surge in products delivered to the home. Including products that were traditionally only bought in-store, including: The best example of this trend might be the DTC mattress category. Brands like Nectar Mattress have seen rapid growth largely by delivering a product that was previously seen as too large and bulky to deliver to people's homes. Then the pandemic happened. Searches for ""Nectar Mattress"" over the last 5 years. And suddenly, consumers expected everything delivered to their doorstep. The plant delivery space is a great example of the ""everything delivered"" trend. Searches for ""plant delivery"" spiked at the start of the pandemic. Plants are difficult to ship. But, like essentially all products, consumers now want them delivered anyway. And a handful of companies that have pounced on this demand (like Bloom & Wild), have seen rapid growth. According to research by IBM, 77% of consumers consider sustainability and environmental responsibility to be at least ""moderately important"" brand values. Consumers support environmentally responsible products. Harvard Business School report that sustainable products have 5.6x higher average sales growth compared to those that aren't marketed as sustainable. So there's no question that sustainable products from ethical companies is one of the biggest consumer behavior trends to keep an eye on over the next 3-4 years. An example of a growing sustainable product category is bamboo toilet paper. Searches for ""bamboo toilet paper"" spiked during COVID. But is still seeing growth (113% in 5 years). Unlike traditional toilet paper, bamboo toilet paper is sourced from a plant with a relatively small negative environmental impact: bamboo. (This category's growth is also due to the fact that companies started to offer at-home bamboo toilet paper delivery.) Consumers not only want products that are sustainable. They also want to buy from brands that act ethically. In fact, a recent survey found that 32% of US and UK consumers would pay more for the same product if that product came from an ethical brand. Telemedicine usage surged during the pandemic. Some estimates say that the number of telemedicine appointments increased by 5,000% during the height of the pandemic. However, doctor visits are just one of many areas of health and wellness that have shifted largely to the home. Another growing at-home health trend is at-home spa treatments. Even though many spas have reopened (albeit with restrictions), we're seeing continued demand for spa treatments that can be done at home. For example, Dermaplaning. Searches for ""Dermaplaning"" have increased by 2,400% over the last 10 years. Dermaplaning is a skincare treatment usually done at a spa or a dermatologist's office. But consumers are now using at-home kits to take this skincare routine into their homes. We're also seeing consumers replace their gym with at-home versions. Searches for ""garage gym"" spiked during lockdowns. Global Google search growth for ""garage gyms"". Even with gyms now open, interest in at-home gyms hasn't completely died down. That leads us to our next consumer behavior trend. Millennials and Gen Z consumers continue to rely on influencers for product discovery. And for choosing which brands to trust. In fact, according to Influencer Marketing Hub, the influencer marketing market has increased year-over-year, reaching an estimated $13.8 billion in 2021. This is why influencer marketing is still a growing marketing channel. And one that many marketers rely on. However, the way consumers interact with and buy from influencers is changing. Specifically, consumers now seek out recommendations from social media influencers that may only have a small, niche audience. An industry study by HypeAuditor found that social accounts between 1k-5k followers get 2x more relative engagement on each post than influencers with a larger following. This is why we're seeing an increasing number of brands seek out ""micro influencers"". Searches for ""micro influencers"", who are influencers with <50k followers on a given platform, have increased by 7,800% over 10 years. A recent report found that 40% of brands that use influencer marketing have decided to partner with a micro influencer over a traditional influencer. The monthly subscription industry has grown rapidly with subscribers increasing by 90% year-over-year. This growth is largely due to the fact that consumers are more open to subscribing to monthly products and services than ever before. And, from Amazon Prime to video streaming services, there's now a wide array of monthly subscription products to choose from. For example, video games have historically been one-off purchases. You see a game that you want. Buy it at a one-time price. And play the game for an unlimited amount of time. This is still largely the case. But we're also seeing Sony, Microsoft, and other gaming industry giants roll out subscription gaming services. Which are essentially the Netflix for video games. For example, Sony's PS Now service streams hundreds of titles for a monthly subscription fee. And it quickly grew to 3.2 million+ subscribers. Searches for ""PS Now"" had been rising over the last 5 years before a recent dip. Other examples of this consumer trend include monthly boxes, streaming services, and meditation apps. The US pet furniture market size alone is worth over $2 billion. And pet owners are now more willing than ever to shell out big bucks to increase their pets’ quality of life. The pet market is growing steadily. And a growing piece of the industry is based on luxury products. For example, CBD for dogs, organic cat food, and devices for owners to video-call their pets. Search growth for ""CBD for dogs"" is up 1,400% in 10 years. No matter the product: if it will make their pets happier, there’s likely going to be a group of owners who will buy it. A few more examples: If Fido has too much ice cream (or too many Starbucks Puppuccinos) you can buy him a dog treadmill. Or help him get back in balance with some raw dog food or dog supplements. Searches for “dog supplements” have been rising each year. If Fido still isn’t back in shape after that, it may be time to buy some pet insurance. But why are people spending so much on their pets now? Like many consumer behavior trends over the past year, the answer is: probably the pandemic. Owners are more willing to buy luxury pet products having recently seen their pets more often. The trend has been growing for longer than that, though. As a long-term movement, luxury pet products are most likely related to the fact that fewer people are having children. (And opting for “fur babies” instead.) Which is a larger trend that’s expected to continue worldwide. The global meditation market is expected to grow from $4.08 billion in 2019 to $9 billion in 2027 (at a 10.4% CAGR). Growth of the meditation market into 2027. Calm is an app that offers short, themed meditations for increasing concentration or tackling difficult emotions. And outside of its regular meditations, Calm features the voices of celebrities like LeBron James and Matthew McConaughey. Calm has a free basic plan as well as a premium membership for $69.99 per year. To date, the company has raised $218 million in VC funding. One of Calm’s biggest competitors is Headspace, founded in London in 2010 but now headquartered in California. Headspace gets new users started with a 10-day introductory course to guided meditation. It also features “mindfulness workouts” and physical stretching exercises. Headspace’s pricing is similar to Calm’s, with a $69.99 annual subscription as well as a $12.99 monthly option. The company has raised $215.9 million to date, including $100.7 million in equity and $40 million in debt in 2020. Waking Up is another example. The guided meditation app features Sam Harris, author of the NYT bestselling book of the same name. Its price is higher than Calm and Headspace, at $99.99 per year. Searches for “Waking Up app” are up 1,225% in 10 years. The Ten Percent Happier meditation app is also based on a bestselling book. It offers a free version as well as a $99/year membership. Ten Percent Happier has raised $8.1 million to date. Google searches for ""Ten Percent Happier"" are up 600% in 5 years. Inner Explorer has designed a mindfulness system and app for teachers. The non-profit’s daily exercises are currently used by over 5,000 schools and reach more than 1.7 million students. Which they say has led to 28% higher student grades and a 43% decrease in teacher-reported stress. Other popular meditation apps include Insight Timer (for which searches have increased 85% in five years) and Breethe (for which searches are up 30%). Biofeedback startups are taking a different approach to the mindfulness space. Biofeedback consists of monitoring your body’s reactions (like heartbeat, breathing, and brain activity) so that you can try to control your stress, emotions, motivation, or ability to focus. Research shows that biofeedback may even help treat conditions like migraines and high blood pressure. One interesting biofeedback startup is Muse. Muse makes EEG headbands designed to help users meditate and sleep better. Combined with its companion app, the device plays the sound of peaceful weather as you focus on your breathing. When your mind wanders, the noises turn stormy to remind you to relax. The startup has raised $39.9 million since it was founded in 2007. The Muse 2 EEG headband. EMOTIV makes similar EEG headbands but is designed to monitor stress and help users focus. Dreem’s headbands are made to aid sleep. And MindLabs raised a $1.4 million pre-seed round to launch its “Peloton for mental health”. Which will consist of EEG headbands, guided meditations, and live video courses. While Halo Neuroscience works in the opposite direction. Rather than simply measuring brain activity, the company’s “Halo Sport” device generates an electrical current to stimulate the wearer’s brain. According to the company, its technology can improve performance in activities like learning guitar, endurance cycling, and playing piano. The Halo Sport by Halo Neuroscience. Growing low-tech mindfulness practice is personal journaling. Journaling is said to help people manage anxiety, focus on priorities, reduce distractions, and identify opportunities for growth. And it’s been recommended by famous personalities like Oprah Winfrey and Tim Ferriss. That may be why search interest in journaling is up over 5 years: Searches for ""journaling"" are up 133% in 10 years. Journaling habits range from free-form writing to trademarked practices like “Morning Pages” and the Bullet Journal, to other structured forms like gratitude journaling. Searches for “gratitude journal” have increased by 138% in 5 years. Here are a few players in the journaling space: Jour is a guided journaling app that’s used by over 800k people. The startup raised a $1.8 million seed round. Intelligent Change has sold over 1 million copies of its structured physical journals, “The Five Minute Journal” and “Productivity Planner”. It also sells app versions of them. And Glimpses is a Windows-based journaling tool"
The great consumer shift: Ten charts that show how US shopping behavior ...,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-great-consumer-shift-ten-charts-that-show-how-us-shopping-behavior-is-changing,"Skip to main content Tamara Charm Becca Coggins Kelsey Robinson Jamie Wilkie (13 pages) Anyone who has hosted a game night over video chat or ordered groceries to be delivered at home for the first time understands how profoundly the COVID-19 crisis has changed our behavior as consumers. But which of these changes will stick? We see several that are key: We’ve boiled down extensive McKinsey consumer research into ten exhibits to illustrate the trends and the consumer segments associated with each. Physical distancing and stay-at-home orders have forced whole consumer segments to shop differently. A few months into COVID-19, consumer shopping online has increased significantly across many categories. Consumer intent to shop online continues to increase, especially in essentials and home-entertainment categories. More interestingly, these habits seem like they’re going to stick as US consumers report an intent to shop online even after the COVID-19 crisis. Categories where expected growth in online shoppers exceeds 35 percent include essentials such as over-the-counter (OTC) medicine, groceries, household supplies, and personal-care products. Even discretionary categories such as skin care and makeup, apparel, and jewelry and accessories show expected customer growth of more than 15 percent. 1 While the shift to online shopping has been near universal across categories, high-income earners and millennials are leading the way in shifting spend online across both essential and nonessential items. Gen X has experienced a similar online shift, although not at the same scale as millennials. Gen Z has concentrated its shift online in particular categories: apparel and footwear, at-home entertainment, and food takeout/delivery. 2 Visit our Consumer & Shopper Insights page The crisis has prompted a surge of new activities, with an astonishing 75 percent of US consumers trying a new shopping behavior in response to economic pressures, store closings, and changing priorities. This general change in behavior has also been reflected in a shattering of brand loyalties, with 36 percent of consumers trying a new product brand and 25 percent incorporating a new private-label brand. Of consumers who have tried different brands, 73 percent intend to continue to incorporate the new brands into their routine. Gen Z and high earners are most prone to switching brands. The beneficiaries of this shift include big, trusted brands, which are seeing 50 percent growth during the crisis, and private labels, which have outpaced the retail market. Some 80 percent of customers who started using a private brand during the pandemic indicate they intend to continue using it once the COVID-19 crisis subsides. 3 Shoppers have cited a number of reasons for switching brands, with availability (in-store and online), convenience, and value leading the pack. For marketers, this highlights the need to quickly become aware of when shoppers are migrating brands or retailers and then to manage the logistics to ensure product and service availability. Looking at China, which is further along in its recovery cycle than most countries, the increase in promotional activity to cater to consumers’ focus on value in apparel is expected to continue. 4 As Americans contemplate going back out to shop, hygiene and hygiene transparency have emerged as important sources of concern. It is becoming increasingly important for stores and restaurants to not only follow hygiene protocols (thorough cleaning and masks for consumers and employees are top priorities) but also communicate effectively that they are following those procedures. US consumers have already started to change their behavior in response to hygiene concerns. Technologies that enhance hygiene, particularly contactless activities such as food and grocery delivery and curbside pickup, are taking off. There is strong intent to continue contactless activities across the United States. As an example, 79 percent of consumers intend to continue or increase their usage of self-checkout in retail after COVID-19. Millennials and Gen Z are the widest adopters of contactless activities. 5 Around 40 percent of US consumers have reduced spending in general, and they expect to continue to cut back on nonessentials specifically. This reality reflects profound discomfort about the state of the economy. With overall consumer spending declining, intent to spend in essential categories is increasing. Even among those with higher incomes, we see that while essentials show spending momentum, intent to buy discretionary products still lags significantly. As the worst of the crisis abates, we do see online spending in nonessential categories such as apparel and footwear starting to come back. This effect is strongest among high-income earners, consumers in the Northeast, and Gen Z. 6 Tied to the concern about the state of the economy is an increasing consumer focus on value—especially for essential categories. For example, in shampoo on Amazon, value and mass products have experienced the greatest increase in share, at two- and five-percentage-points gains, respectively. Premium shampoo products have seen significantly less growth in comparison, losing more than five points of volume. 7 Read the article Americans are spending more of their at-home time on domestic activities, media, and news. Intent to eat more at home post-COVID-19 has strengthened significantly over the past three months. Usage of popular online entertainment platforms has skyrocketed. (The popular video game Fortnite recently hosted a concert that was “attended” by 12.3 million users.1Andrew Webster, “More than 12 million people attended Travis Scott’s Fortnite concert,” The Verge, April 23, 2020, theverge.com.) Investment in at-home fitness through equipment purchases and online activity is growing. Consumers still expect to spend more time on at-home activities, even in less-restricted regions. 1Andrew Webster, “More than 12 million people attended Travis Scott’s Fortnite concert,” The Verge, April 23, 2020, theverge.com. Andrew Webster, “More than 12 million people attended Travis Scott’s Fortnite concert,” The Verge, April 23, 2020, theverge.com.

Andrew Webster, “More than 12 million people attended Travis Scott’s Fortnite concert,” The Verge, April 23, 2020, theverge.com. 8 As economies reopen, 73 percent of consumers are still hesitant to resume regular activities outside the home. They are concerned about going to a hair salon, gym, or restaurant, but are especially worried about shared environments, such as public transportation, ride sharing, air travel, and being in crowded spaces, such as attending large indoor or outdoor events. 9 US consumer-segment behavior varies significantly across the next-normal trends. We have identified five customer segments driven by optimism, health, and financial concerns, each of relatively similar size. These five segments exhibit the consumer trends to a different degree and have the following characteristics: Affluent and unaffected: These consumers express general optimism about the future (~20 percent higher than the overall US consumer population), skew male (60 percent), and make more than $100,000 a year. They tend to be able to stay at home during the pandemic crisis, allowing them to shop more online. This group is slightly less price sensitive than other cohorts due to greater job stability. Uprooted and underemployed: These consumers are feeling major impact on both their finances and health due to job insecurity. They are cautious about how they spend money, with low optimism about future economic conditions. Not surprisingly, this group is trading down to essentials and value, swapping out brands, and shopping online when possible. Financially secure but anxious: This population is largely 65 years old and older and is generally pessimistic about economic conditions after COVID-19, which has had a major impact on their habits. This group has expressed the greatest need for hygiene transparency, with above-average concerns on safety and well-being and concerns about the ability to get necessary supplies. Out trying to make ends meet: These consumers are being cautious about how they spend money and feel that their jobs and job security have been heavily impacted by COVID-19. This group has significant representation from minority groups and rural populations. They are less likely to be able to stay at home (hence their lower likelihood to be part of the homebody economy), but they are strongly moving toward shopping for essentials and value. Disconnected and retired: This category denotes those who are retired, over 65, and have a lower income level than the financially-secure-but-anxious segment. They are broadly optimistic about economic conditions after COVID-19 and are less likely to display any of the next-normal characteristics. Predominantly from Southern and suburban areas of the country, this group has not exhibited significant changes in shopping behavior. 10 As retailers contemplate the changes in consumer behavior, they will need to adjust their strategies and execution to adapt to the new norms, including: Further, it will be important for brands to reevaluate and reprioritize their target audience and consumer segments, as the emphasis on each of the next-normal trends will vary based on the target consumer.

Understanding Consumer Behavior Trends: 5 Trends of 2022,https://communicationmgmt.usc.edu/blog/consumer-behavior-trends,"MASTER OF COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT ONLINE November 15, 2023 View all blog posts under Articles View all blog posts under As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow in both use and popularity, its impact on the consumer continues to change the marketplace. In 2022, people are starting to look for more commerce-related balance, establishing an equilibrium between technology and human interactions in their buying decisions. At the same time, people are expressing an increased desire for convenience in their shopping choices. They are more comfortable receiving recommendations on new products or services from social media influencers. All these dynamics create an interesting quandary for retailers and other brands who must learn to market to buyers with these new desires. In light of this shift, brands and those who study business and marketing must find new ways to connect with customers. While technology is still an important element, people are starting to shift toward wanting a balance between convenience and human interactions. As you work toward earning a communication degree online, understanding the consumer business trends that impact consumers and their buying decisions will be helpful. So, how has the customer changed in 2022? As you consider marketing to the current demographic, keep in mind that in 2022: Technology, personal perception, environmentalism and convenience are prime movers for 2022’s consumers. Keep these trends in mind when developing a marketing and communications strategy. 1. Convergence of Digital and Physical Shopping Today’s consumer is interested in both remote and in-person shopping experiences. It’s a trend prominent enough to spawn new words designed to describe this convergence from both the consumer's and company’s perspective. The first term coined as a result of this trend is the word: “phygital.” It refers to the merged brick-and-mortar experience and the online shopping experience. Another term to emerge is: “omnichannel,” which describes a company’s approach to providing customers with a consistent experience regardless of how they shop, whether in person, online or on a mobile device. 2. A New Definition of Beauty All brands must understand what consumers define as beautiful, as it will impact everything from the selection of models for advertisements to the products people choose to buy. The definition of beauty is changing as consumers push for diversity and inclusivity. Many shoppers respond positively to ads that include people with disabilities, people of different body sizes and people with a diverse set of physical features. On the other hand, consumers are responding negatively and rejecting brands that push a specific “traditional” definition of beauty. Beauty is now seen as a way to express one’s self, rather than a way to fit into a mold. Brands that respond to this consumer behavior trend by embracing diversity in both their products and their advertising choices will see greater success as 2022 progresses. 3. The Role of “Influencers” Will Become Even Greater Social influencers are growing in importance among brands and marketing professionals. A recommendation from a well-loved blogger or radio personality can drive more sales than a strategically positioned advertisement. Reviews from real consumers will influence more buying decisions than just about anything else. Influencers are valuable in changing consumer actions because of the many different platforms they use for their messages. From online platforms to Instagram, to other social media channels, to radio and television advertising, influential people can leverage multiple channels to drive purchase decisions. Brands that incorporate this knowledge into their marketing plans will find greater success in the coming years. 4. Demand for Eco-Friendly, Sustainable Options Environmental awareness is not a new trend, but in 2022 it continues to become increasingly important to consumers. A report by IBM revealed that 49% of consumers over 12 months paid an average of 59% more for products that labeled themselves as socially responsible or sustainable. Additionally, 51% of those surveyed noted environmental sustainability is more important now than it was a year ago. Meeting these eco-responsible goals can take on many forms, from using recycled packaging to phasing out single-use plastic products. While this trend does not necessarily mean a company has to adopt a fully sustainable approach, it does mean ignoring the impact that sustainability can have on the bottom line doesn’t make good business sense. 5. Delivery on Demand Convenience matters to the consumer in 2022. Nothing exemplifies this like the popularity of delivery on-demand services. This concept makes it possible for the consumer to receive a product or service at a specific location at a moment’s notice. For consumers, this eliminates the inconvenience of going to a physical location to pick something up. Delivery on demand is most commonly associated with restaurant food delivery services such as DoorDash and Uber Eats, but the category encompasses a wide range of services. Dry cleaning, massages and even childcare services can be obtained through on-demand services. The way a brand communicates its value to its target market is essential to its success. Marketing and communication professionals must understand consumer behavior trends to better serve their clients. When you as a communication professional can capture the ethos and essence of today’s consumers, you are better able to draft communications that highlight brand value, framing it in light of the consumer’s unique desires. Marketing professionals who adapt to trends early can gain an advantage over those who lag behind. The USC online masters in Management offers a robust curriculum. Courses focus on a variety of topics covering consumer behaviors that teach students to identify and adapt to changes in consumer preferences as they unfold. Learn how USC can help you identify and leverage the consumer trends that keep businesses relevant.

Find content by Three Digital Shopping Trends to Watch in 2024 2/14/2024 Michelle Evans Share: This article originally appeared in Forbes. Out of the eight billion people in the world today, 64% use the internet, double the rate from a decade ago. Internet access has disrupted consumer life, including how they shop. Euromonitor International forecasts that consumers will spend nearly USD11 trillion on goods and services bought online in 2024. This growing digital base needs to be at the center of your retail strategy. At NRF 2024: Retail’s Big Show in January, I spoke about the digital shopper trends that will have the biggest impact on retailers and brands. Let’s break down three big ones to watch in 2024. The rising influence of digital channels is putting pressure on companies to improve the online experience. This is becoming possible due to evolving data-gathering strategies and emerging technologies, from AR to IoT to generative AI. These advances have the potential to transform the online shopping experience, leading to one that is more intuitive. Consumers have greater expectations. About half of digital consumers want one-of-a-kind offerings. A fifth note the desire for more personalized shopping experiences. In both cases, these sentiments are higher among the most digitally savvy population, according to Euromonitor’s consumer research. That is telling as this shift toward a more intuitive experience is playing out on digital channels where these consumers shop more frequently. In part, this means ensuring the online channel is more akin to what a consumer might experience in person. While a variety of data and tech will be used, generative AI is poised to take on a central role in shaping the online experience. Generative AI can be leveraged in a variety of ways, from improving customer service to tailoring marketing messages to optimizing supply chains. Virtual assistants powered by generative AI can create a more intuitive experience by using additional information sources for added context. Zalando’s new chatbot offers suggestions based on natural questions the shopper might ask, and in the future, could be combined with personal preferences, taking steps toward making the discovery experience feel more intuitive. Source: Euromonitor’s Voice of the Industry Survey, 2023 New technologies like generative AI could give brands a competitive advantage. The pioneers who can create a next-generation shopping experience using these advances will be the ones that fuel a new shopping behavior and usher in the next so-called “Uber moment.” Digital consumers are flocking to TikTok and its Chinese sister platform, Douyin. Brands are striving to promote their products and services on these platforms known for their short-form video content, but some of the viral trends that are doing the most to boost brand sales are emerging organically from users on those platforms. These ByteDance platforms are not only some of the most popular, but also the fastest growing. As of 2023, 43% of digital consumers globally report using them monthly, a 19-percentage-point jump in three years, according to Euromonitor’s Voice of the Consumer: Digital Survey. These short-form video platforms, also known for their endless scroll and advanced algorithms, are a hit with young consumers, especially Gen Z. Although most marketing campaigns on TikTok are financed or initiated by brands, some of the most viral content is organic. In 2023, an Israeli TikTok influencer posted a video of herself wrapping a frozen Betty Crocker Fruit Roll-Up processed snack around ice cream to create a crunchy fruit-flavored ice cream cone. Almost overnight, Fruit Roll-Ups began flying off shelves, creating a black market. ByteDance platforms are dabbling in retail. In 2020, Douyin pivoted from being a pure social media platform to a retailer, prioritizing smaller sellers with a low-fee structure with revenue supplemented by advertising. Douyin has seen massive e-commerce gains. Online sales of beauty and personal care products on Douyin’s marketplace surged 81% in the first nine months of 2023, as compared with the same period in 2022, according to Euromonitor’s new e-commerce research. As for TikTok, its TikTok Shop is finding success in Southeast Asia and set up shop in the US and UK in September. Consumers have long wanted hassle-free returns but delivering on that expectation has not been without challenges. The convergence of trends, like the rise of e-commerce, closure of stores by some retail chains and boost in sustainable strategies, is moving returns up the industry agenda. New technologies and partnerships are paving the way to a happier return experience for shoppers. Creating a hassle-free return experience is not without challenges. First, what is deemed hassle-free varies by consumer. Although 43% of digital consumers point to mail as the preferred channel for online purchase returns, preferences vary by generation. For example, baby boomers prefer to return by mail, while Gen Z prefer to return in-store. To solve the unhappy return experience, the industry needs to shift its mindset, viewing this as being about improving loyalty, rather than a revenue drain. Retailers are deploying a variety of tactics to reduce returns or at least their impact on the bottom line. Electronics specialist Best Buy is opening 10 smaller outlets, specializing in selling used and refurbished electronics. The aim of these stores is to target budget-conscious shoppers and recoup more from open-box and return products. More and more retailers are outsourcing the return experience to companies like Happy Returns or Loop Returns, which provide merchants with a customizable online portal for returns and exchanges. To date, many retailers have struggled to grasp the pivotal role returns play in shaping customer loyalty and, as such, have sidelined this moment. That’s changing. Source: Euromonitor International’s Voice of the Industry: Retail Survey These trends demonstrate how online shopping continues to mature, improving the customer experience from the moment of discovery to potential product return. A second, prominent theme is how consumers desire more power in their relationship with brands. TikTok Economy is rooted in how consumers are using social media to gain power in the value exchange. This power has led to more authentic messaging, which resonates with younger consumers like Gen Z.

That’s why we create our annual Top Global Consumer Trends report. Predicting customer needs and delivering solutions to their pain points are not easy tasks. This report is your starting point, so you can get to the bottom of consumer behaviour and lifestyle shifts.

Get the report or watch our webinar for case studies and tactics that’ll help you respond to these demands. Two words: generative AI. You’ve probably even asked ChatGPT or Bard a question or two in recent months. This trend is all about ongoing experimentation and shifting expectations of generative AI solutions. As consumers keep testing the capabilities of this technology, they expect brands to do the same to create optimised and personalised customer experiences. Economic instability, political turmoil and everyday stressors make our lives feel overwhelming at times. We want to find daily doses of happiness that give us brief relief from reality. Joy and optimism are at the core of this trend. Delightful Distractions evoke positivity—whether that’s a product designed with vibrant colours, playful brand content or an immersive experience, among other approaches. Source: Euromonitor’s Voice of the Consumer: Digital Survey 2023 Find moments where you can uplift your customers because those touchpoints leave a lasting impression. Green fatigue is hitting new heights, but environmental concerns still weigh heavy on our minds. Over the years, consumers adopted sustainable habits to try and have a positive impact on the planet. Yet, climate catastrophes continue to cause devastation around the world. People realise that their individual actions help…to an extent. If consumers aren’t aware of how their behaviour makes a difference, they could feel discouraged and might not put in as much effort. Real change needs to be a collective priority with companies and governments in the driver’s seat. Social or political issues can be sensitive—sometimes, contentious—topics that cause a divide, creating Progressively Polarised behaviour. How this trend translates into purchase decisions is nuanced. Some shoppers buy products that reflect their values, like sustainability or political affiliation, whilst others focus on benefits or price instead. But consumers often exhibit both tendencies. For example, someone could buy toothpaste based on functionality—to prevent cavities or protect enamel—whilst purchasing eco-friendly laundry detergent tablets to limit plastic consumption. Controversial campaigns that push a social or partisan agenda can also become purchase detractors, even if those values weren’t purchase motivators. Complex, right? Brands have to tread a fine line here, especially with upcoming 2024 elections around the world. Inaction isn’t the answer. You need to remain authentic and align with the values of your target audience. Remember Budgeteers and Here and Now from last year? Well, this trend is an evolution of those financial mindsets. Rather than cutting overall spending or occasionally splurging on small treats, consumers are being clever to get what they want. That could be finding dupes, so trading down on cost but not quality, or shopping at stores with rewards perks to rack up points for future purchases. These kinds of lifestyle tricks help them make the most of their money. Easy and effective—that’s what underpins self-care routines this year. Forget the 10-step beauty regimens or elaborate meal prepping. Wellness products that are convenient to use and deliver noticeable results win out here. Consumers are setting realistic goals and are open to trying new treatments or brands—if they’ll achieve their desired outcome. That means proven efficacy will influence purchase choices. Those are the top lifestyle trends of the year! Here are a few resources you should check out (if you haven’t already) to get deeper insights and activation tactics: Interested in more insights?

A competitor analysis, also called competitive analysis and competition analysis, is the process of examining similar brands in your industry to gain insight into their offerings, branding, sales, and marketing approaches. Knowing your competitors in business analysis is important if you’re a business owner, marketer, start-up founder, or product developer. A competitor analysis offers several benefits, including: Understanding industry standards so that you can meet and exceed them Discovering untapped niche markets Differentiating products and services Fulfilling customers’ desires and solving their problems better than competitors Distinguishing your brand Standing out in your marketing Measuring your growth The sections below provide a competitor analysis framework for evaluating your industry’s competitive landscape. Return to this framework regularly and apply the insights to develop your business. Start by reviewing your own business values, goals, branding, products, and services. That way, you can easily identify existing brands that target customers might choose over yours. Next, turn to Google. Type in your product name or category. What brands and companies come up when you search ""hydrating lipstick"", for example? What comes up when you search social media channels for relevant hashtags or keywords? Using the information you gathered, make a list of up to 10 brands whose offerings most resemble yours and present your target customers with comparable alternatives. Identify potential direct competitors (those who sell a similar product to a similar audience) and indirect competitors (those who sell a different product to a similar audience). By examining how competitors structure their businesses, you can gauge how equipped they are to grow, gain market share, and earn customer loyalty in your target market. Review each competitor’s website and social media profile to gather the following information: How large is the company, in terms of the number of leaders and employees? How many years has the company been in operation? What job openings do these companies list on Glassdoor, Indeed, or LinkedIn? What are their areas of expansion? For publicly traded companies, you may be able to review their annual reports and gain insight into how much revenue they’re generating, their debt and liability, and other performance metrics. A value proposition is a short statement that summarizes the benefits of a product and why a customer would choose it over competing products. A value proposition often looks something like the following: We help [target customer] do [outcome, benefit, experience] by doing / offering [product or service]. In this section, you will understand competitors’ value propositions in order to ensure your product or service stands out in the marketplace. Review major competitors’ site copy, particularly on the ""About"" or What We Do"" pages, as well as analyzing any blogs and stories on their website. Answer these questions for each competitor: What problems and pain points do competitors’ products solve? What desires do the products fulfill? What benefits or outcomes does the product deliver for customers? What data do they cite to support their claims about products’ benefits? What pricing structure do competitors use? Evaluate how competitors position themselves in the marketplace. This will allow you to create a marketing strategy that gets your brand in front of your target audience. For each competitor, answer these questions: What social media influencers does this company partner with to leverage their authority, authentic content, and personal connections to target customers? What affiliate marketing or brand ambassador programs does this company offer to leverage the recommendations of satisfied customers? What kind of digital or traditional paid advertising presence does this company have? On what marketing channels do competitors publish organic content, including websites, landing pages, social media platforms, and email? What type of content do you see, including articles, videos, ebooks, reports, commercials, and digital ads? Read more: Marketing Strategy: What It Is and How to Create One Get to know your competitors by auditing their brand identities and getting a sense of why customers might feel connected (and loyal) to that brand. For each competitor, answers these questions: If this company were a person, how would you describe its personality? What words, phrases, tone, and style does this company use in its messaging? What values do competitors communicate through their messaging? How would you describe the visual elements of this company’s branding? And how do those elements correspond to the brand’s values, voice, and personality? What emotions do the brand elements evoke in customers? Read more: What Is a Brand Strategy? And How to Create One Study the customer journeys that your competitors have set up to nurture and convert customers. Your goal is to gauge how seamless, integrated, and logical it is to go from the first touchpoint to making a purchase and beyond. Start by following your competitors on social media, subscribing to them via email, and purchasing products and services to experience each customer journey for yourself. As you experience the customer journey for each competitor, gather information on the following: What are the different touchpoints along this company’s customer journey? What elements make it easy to keep moving along the customer journey? What calls to action and instructions are there to make it clear how to proceed? What kinds of content educate and entertain you at each touchpoint? What elements create friction or make it difficult to advance to the next step? What do you experience after subscribing or making a purchase? Do you find customer support, upsells, and access to a community? In this step, you will scour competitors’ customer reviews, reactions, and comments on their social media posts, social media mentions, media appearances, and even employee reviews on job sites to understand the perception of competitors in the marketplace. With this information, you can strategize how to garner a positive reputation for your brand, learn from competitors’ mistakes and challenges, and work to avoid any pitfalls yourself. For each competitor, explore the following: How do followers and subscribers interact with this company’s public content? What is the general public sentiment regarding this company, based on mentions, product reviews, and social media likes and comments? Include praise as well as complaints. What experiences do employees have, based on reviews on job sites like Glassdoor and Indeed? Share of voice measures how much of the market your brand owns compared to competitors. By determining the share of voice, you can gauge how visible, authoritative, and popular your brand is in the marketplace. A SWOT analysis is a classic exercise for identifying the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats that exist within the competitive landscape. Conduct a SWOT analysis of your competitors to consolidate everything you’ve learned into a succinct story. What strengths do you see in competitors’ branding, marketing, customer journeys, and products? What weaknesses do you see in competitors’ branding, marketing, customer journeys, and products? What opportunities do you see for your business to capitalize on? What is your competition doing that might pose a threat to your business? You can also list the strengths and weaknesses of your business as it currently stands and compare them side-by-side with those of competitors. For more on SWOT analysis, watch this video from the Business Strategy Specialization: Once you’ve conducted a competitor analysis, your next step is to apply the insights to your business. Use the following prompts to differentiate your brand, products, and services from competitors and gain market share: What product features can you add that differentiate your product from competitors? What pricing strategy can you use to attract new customers to your offerings? What design features can you add to your brand to make it stand out? How can you compose a value proposition that stands out from competitors? We help [target customer] do [outcome, benefit, experience] by doing / offering [product or service]. How can you design a more seamless, frictionless customer journey that leads consumers to make a purchase and become loyal brand ambassadors? How can you create content that improves on that of your competitors, including covering new topics, addressing ignored pain points, recommending new solutions, and offering more exciting experiences? How can you improve your social media strategy to reach new potential customers? What approaches can you take on marketing channels where your competitors have a presence to distinguish your messaging and present your offerings as the best choice? On which marketing channels do your competitors not (yet) have a presence? What steps can you take to establish and grow a presence on those channels? Remember that conducting a competitor analysis is a crucial step in developing your business. It can help you differentiate your brand and present your products and services as the best on the market. Return to your competitor analysis efforts regularly, such as every quarter, six months, or year, to account for shifts in competitors’ tactics and new competitors that arrive on the scene. Always look for ways to give your brand and products a competitive edge.
